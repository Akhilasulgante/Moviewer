The photography, narration and general story telling of the lives of the animals is simply breath-taking.

Episode 1 was animals that live on islands. As others have mentioned I have never seen such a more terrifying piece of natural-history photography in my life. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it or caught it on YouTube but I never thought I would be shouting at the TV for Iguana's to run. 

Episode 2 was mountain living wildlife from Grizzly Bears coming out of hibernation to Snow Leopards. 

This programme is one of the few examples which envelopes you in its documentary telling. You are seeing things for the first time and you are left with wanting more. Roll on episode 3, jungles.",

Kurt Cobain sang his heart out and all the world watched. This show displayed all of his talents and all of his pain. This is the best ""MTV Unplugged"" and the best live performance of any band.

Band of Brothers,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3ODc2ODc0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjgzNjc3._V1_.jpg,"Action,Drama,History,War","Scott Grimes,Damian Lewis,Ron Livingston,Shane Taylor",N/A,"Band of Brothers is a TV mini-series starring Scott Grimes, Damian Lewis, and Ron Livingston.

I couldn't wait to see each episode. Co-Executive Produced by Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, it has the realism, look and feel of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) but with more insight into the characters. Hanks even directed one episode himself.

 Told over ten gut wrenching episodes, the story centers on a company of soldiers in the 101st American Airborne Division in WWII from their initial basic training to their landing in France on D-Day to their many battles and ordeals through to the liberation of a concentration camp and finally through to the end of the war.

 The soldiers are ordinary people thrust into horrific situations and shows how each is able (or not able) to deal with the situations. The battle scenes are realistic and convincing and the special effects are breath taking. While the series depicts the trials and tribulations of the company, it isn't afraid to show how the war affects seemingly sane and rational men. For example there is a scene where the nominal hero of the story, Winters (Damien Lewis) shoots an unarmed German soldier out of frustration. There is also a scene where a group of German prisoners are cut down by an American officer after he had given them cigarettes. Even after the German surrender there are instances of out and out murder of Germans. This is very rare for an American war story.

 The cast is of largely unknown actors, which makes for a more effective telling of the story. There is no John Wayne leading the troops to victory kind of thing. Damien Lewis is very good as Winters who rises through the ranks to lead the company. Ron Livingston plays his friend and second in command, Nixon. Others include David Schwimmer, excellent as the training officer, Scott Grimes as Malarkey the grizzled sergeant and ex New Boys on the Block member Donnie Wahlberg effective as Corporal Lipton.

 ""Band of Brothers"" is a story that could only be told in a mini-series. It clearly shows that war really is hell.",

I own an extensive DVD-collection, but if I had to choose 1 title and had to throw away everything else I had, this would be the one I'd keep. I have no better DVD-title in my collection. Period.

David Attenborough is my personal hero. Although he merely provides the commentary for this series (as he did with the also terrific Blue Planet), but his work for the BBC's Natural History division (setting it up and making several brilliant series himself) and his inspiring personality make him one of the true greats.

Before I saw the episode, I was both excited and worried at the same time because I did not want to be disappointed after waiting for so long to see it after watching the teaser trailer. But Setven Moffat pulled it off, and in a way you can never imagine. He takes us for a ride into the realms of Gallifrey with such detail and yet with the hint of humor.

The praise is well-deserved.

During a meteor storm, McCoy accidentally injects himself with an overdose of cordrazine, which leads him to paranoid insanity. He beams himself down to the planet being orbited by the Enterprise, escapes through a time portal, resulting in the obliteration of the Enterprise's world. Kirk and Spock go back through the portal to try and intercept McCoy (who has interfered with the past), and land in the New York City of the 1930s. They are taken in by Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), a pacifistic social worker, and Kirk begins to fall in love.

As the summary indicates, this episode is the perfect confluence of superb science fiction writing (Harlan Ellison), well-honed directing (Joseph Pevney), and sensitive acting (Shatner and Nimoy in particular). The script is incredibly well-written by one of the best science fiction writers of all time, and uses modest humor (e.g., Spock's clueless insistence on securing platinum, Kirk's explanation of Spock's ears to a policeman, etc.) to keep the story from becoming overly maudlin. For those who believe that William Shatner could not act (i.e., those who had never seen him in his early TV days), his nuanced and sympathetic performance clearly shows how good of an actor he could be. Likewise, Joan Collins acquits herself quite well, and Nimoy is, as always, marvelous. Spock's final line in the 1930s world alone is worth the viewing.",

The movie keeps us remembering the whole funny situations that we were in, during those years; various ways of cheating exams, running out of class with kinds of funny excuses just to go and watch the final matches, smoking in the toilets during the break-time and so on... Of course the movie gives great lessons against these behaivors with the help of one character which lead the whole ""Hababam Sinifi"" series. Mahmut Hodja.

Today I got the Cosmos DVD box set and went completely bananas!  I love it for two reasons.

First: Even for todays standards it is a well made documentation that will make you think about yourself and the world you live in. The Cold War may be over, but people are still as stupid as ever. Cosmos is not just a simple documentation about stars and planets with numbers, technobabble and nice pictures - it's a manifest for peace and understanding that EVERYBODY should see.

Second: I remember when I used to watch the series when I was ten years old. I didn't miss a single episode. Cosmos may not have CHANGED my life - but it certainly gave it a new direction. It taught me to keep an open mind and to care more about my surroundings. When I saw Cosmos today, I felt again like the little boy I was two decades ago. I'm in awe of the whole world and the wonders of the Universe that surrounds every one of us.

If you have kids: show it to them! If you want to know more about life on earth or on other planets: see it! If you think, ordinary documentations about outer space are too complicated to understand: see it! If you don't really care about the Universe, the stars and the planets, but you wonder what all the fuss is about: see it!

In any case: SEE IT!!!",

I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. 

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.

I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.

No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.

The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul.

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect.

Probably the best Ken Burns did outside of The Civil War but it's not without flaws. I liked the first four or five ""innings"" best. After that, things go downhill. The episode covering the 1940s focuses 3/4 of its time on Jackie Robinson. While Robinson and the integration of baseball are certainly important parts of the history of the sport, you're left with the impression it's all Burns really cares about. From this point on in the series, all roads lead back to Robinson and he features prominently in every episode after. It just feels like the first half of the series is a love letter to baseball and the second is more concerned with politics and social issues. Nothing necessarily wrong with that but it does affect the overall congruity of the documentary. Also, as others have noted, the documentary basically loves the New York teams and the Red Sox to death but can barely be bothered to discuss other teams. This is also true of many great players. To have a documentary about the history of baseball and not even mention Stan Musial until he retires is just shameful. There are other greats who are similarly shafted.

The Ninth Inning covers way too broad an era and seems rushed, like they just wanted to get the doc over with. Some great players and achievements from the '80s aren't even talked about. The '70s fares only slightly better. Despite this being released in 1994, you get the impression it was finished several years earlier. For example, near the end they talk about Bo Jackson like he's the next big thing. Jackson had already suffered the injury that derailed his career years before this, yet no mention is made of it. They do tack on something about the Blue Jays winning the World Series at the end, but only because their manager was black and a significant portion of the series, particularly the last half, was devoted to the issues of race in baseball. The Tenth Inning parts that were added many years later don't feel like Ken Burns at all. They're really terrible, to be honest. Some of the interview subjects, like Daniel Okrent and John Thorn, are just apologists for the roidheads and big egos that ruined the sport. Trying to compare some guy using a spitball decades ago to some guy juicing up and shattering cherished records that were earned by men who didn't have to cheat to get it done is just disingenuous and pathetic. Perhaps they are on the MLB payroll. If I sound bitter, it's because I am. I grew up on baseball and loved it. The way some of these guys in the earlier, more nostalgic segments of the documentary talk about the game is how I felt. But the last two decades chased me away and it hurts me to watch it anymore. Anyway, check it out if you have a lot of time to spend on the history of major league baseball. It's not perfect, and I could make a list of things I would change about it, but it kept my interest throughout.",

One more standout scene was her death which made lots of Eponine fans cry. The fact that she was chosen as the definitive character despite of her ethnicity is undeniable. If she had the chance of originating the role, other performers like Frances Ruffelle would get lots of criticism for not measuring up. I recommend the video to anyone just to see Lea's scenes and lots of others like: the face/off songs of Valjean and Javert, the ""One Day More"" finales, and the very funny ""Master of the House"".

This is a further examination of how science and technology have linear relations that spark change through society that, although they may feel like waves, are merely triggers or lynch pins that put other discoveries and events into motion. And, once you know that, how are you going to embrace the new society in the late 20th century and welcome the coming changes in the 21st century.

The whole gist of the series is that once you have this perspective, and know that the world is what you make of it, then, in Burke's opinion, you should shape your world to your needs. And the the reason you should do that is to avoid the pitfalls and mistakes of the past, because he shows you how science and engineering brought society forward, but also how it pushed it back when things went wrong. 

And that's the real gem of the series. He doesn't show us outstanding successes by themselves, and then tout the virtues of science, logic/reason and applications of those methods, but also what drives men forward, and how some men are blinded by ego or desire.

That's about all the series is, though it also serves as a primer for the world about to be ""radically changed"". He of course speaks of the internet going public, and not just confined to labs and universities (as well as military installations), but given to the general public en large. He poses to us, the viewing audience, what if our community were boundless, and was not restrained by the old political boundaries that had held mankind back in previous ages?

From prehistoric man, to the classical era, to medieval times, to the renaissance, to the age of reason and beyond, Burke examines points in history and how that changed our ancestor's view, and how it shaped our present perspective. And he warns and asks us that, knowing this, what will we do with the future tomorrow.

It is a very welcome series shot on the usual UK 16mm format for TV of the 80s and before. Burke's esogination and presentation, as well as the theatrical vignettes, drive home his observations and educated us on passing facts that underline his lessons.

Definitely worth viewing for those of us who came of age before the 90s. Younger audiences may see this series as an anachronism, and who can blame them, because a lot of what Burke foretold has come about. Even so, give it a chance, if for no other reason than to see how us older folks viewed the world that eventually came into being.

After giving HBO massive ratings, and then again on subsequent channels around the world, it was only inevitable that it would have to get a DVD release sooner or later.

Included on the DVD are some of Michael's biggest hits, ranging from Thriller, Billie Jean, Beat It to Man In The Mirror.

The concert begins with something called ""The Toaster Entrance"" this hit headlines around the world, as it saw Michael being catapulted onto the stage to a massive ovation, to start off with the song Jam.

This possibly is the most amazing mix of Choreography and singing that goes together so well, that you will get goose-bumps just watching Michael's presence on stage. The most annoying parts of the concert, would have to be the crowd shots, i mean why buy a concert to see those amazing dance moves in action, only to be shown shots of girls fainting and crying.

Fan or Not, just about anyone will like this concert, as it documents Michael at his highest peak. Either-way it's a great thing to check out.",

Those two words alone summarize what most of the U.S. is missing out on!  Simply put, there isn't a hard rock or heavy metal band on American soil that can even compare.

Rammstein's musicianship far surpasses most hard rock acts of the last few decades.  The music carries pulsing bass rythms with the searing fury of guitar chords, laced with pounding drums and intense synthesizer sounds. All are mixed to perfection to form a unique and almost deadly fury of thrashing rock that is Rammstein.

Rammstein's German vocals and pyrotechnic show only serve to enhance the overall experience of the fury that is their sound.  The shame is that most Americans are missing out on one of the best hard rocks shows ever to take the stage.

Rammstein garnered some success in early 1998 with the single ""Du Hast"". Yet Rammstein is so much more than a one single band.  ""Du Hast"" isn't even Rammstein's best song, despite its popularity.",

It is a bit like David Attenborough for children. It has first class nature photography, but it is aimed at children with a dumbed-down narration by Oprah Winfrey and somewhat Disneyfied music. It sometimes has an odd prudishness about fish reproduction.

The creatures chosen are each bizarre and entertaining but ones I have seen before.

Some of the principles of evolution are presented, but in a subtle way. The focus is on strange animal behaviour, not how it could have evolved. I learned something new, that the schooling behaviour of anchovies is indeed very effective against predators.

It is not totally prettified. It shows flamingo chicks that died after they fell out of the nest.

I think the insect segment was most interesting with the most material I had not seen before. The jousting tournament with the surprise ending really tickled me.

There are bits of Disneyesque anthropomorphising, for example talking of insects ""fighting for their dignity"".

I love films/shows with a psychological emphasis that are somewhat heavy and dark to understand (though not too dark that it verges on horror). The story is well crafted and the different timelines are juxtaposed nicely so that everything comes together in the end. 

The acting is all great as well, with everyone doing their parts convincingly. The dialogue felt very natural and fluent which made the story really feel like a possible future. In addition, the visuals are on point and complements the show nicely. The effects- especially of the 'blocking' materializes the concept of the dark side of technology into something tangible and realizable. It was scary yet fascinating to watch (hopefully this doesn't turn out to be real).

In fact, the comedy's from the 70's made a major impact in the following Turkish comedy history.

Shortly the movie is about a class of slackers, all boys who don't study and are constantly trying to do all kinds of pranks or trying to escape out of the dormitory etc. In this Hababam the whole class actually fails the exams, and the school is threatened to be closed.

Compared to western standards this movie can be seen as a normal family comedy, but the thing what makes it really good is the individual contribution/improvisation of the various actors (whom became one of the greatest of the Turkish comedy history). There is given some decent amount of freedom to the actors to give their own flavor to it. And I think the actors did an excellent job doing this, especially Kemal Sunal and Sener Sen, because of this there are a lot of small very funny scenes throughout the whole movie, which made the movie very enjoyable, rich and therefore re-watchable. 

This movie in particular has something special to it, not only because most people watched this movie over and over since their childhood, but also because of the jokes and it also gets a bit more serious in the end.

No other film shows better the social and cultural framework of Bulgarian society just before the end of the Cold War than Vchera. The film itself is about young people coming of age, struggling with the realities and paradoxes of their future adult life in Bulgarian society. Shown is the ferocious competition within the top classes in Bulgarian society, which was otherwise supposed to be class-free. (This competition actually costs the life of one of the film's characters, Rostislav.) Shown is also the inequality in a society where everyone was supposed to be equal. Shown is the impending sexual revolution in a country that was often hypocritical about sexual issues. The cultural background itself is the paradoxical contrast of the semi-military discipline in socialist high schools vs. the libertarian music of the Beatles, the students clad in drab uniforms vs. the Western ideas that were slowly filtering to them, the profanity and oafishness of the school officials vs. Shakespeare's exquisite poetry that was taught in these schools. (The title Vchera means ""yesterday"" in Bulgarian, the same ""yesterday"" from Shakespeare's verse in Macbeth: ""And all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death ...""). For millions of Bulgarians coming to grips with these contrasts, paradoxes, and realities, the film rings very true, which has helped propel it to near-cult status.

The Three Colors movies and The Double Life of Veronique - the movies for which he is probably best known - would be enough to ensure his reputation, but is this film - or ten films, if you wish - that elevate him.

While the movies are based upon the Ten Commandments, they are not simple morality tales and illustrations.  Kieslowski and his co-writer, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, create meditations that connect both intellectually and emotionally with the commandments instead.  They explore the commandments' themes with the head and the heart.  One great example is the first movie, in which a parent and his child use a computer to predict the freezing rate of a pond.  Casting the computer and human knowledge as false Gods is not a new or unique idea, but in Kieslowski's hands, the idea expands and fills not only the mind but the heart.  Man, I wish I had the vocabulary to express what moves in me every time I watch any one of these films.

Everything about this film, from the cast - always nice to see the ubiquitous Daniel Olbrychski (ubiquitous for Polish films; I always wondered if Poles ever play six degrees of Daniel Olbrychski) - on.  The cinematography for each episode is ideal; the look and feel of these movies, shot with the same director but different cinematographers, are all perfect.

I even loved the theme music.

For those who haven't seen it, Attenborough shows plants to be so much more amazing than animals. They *do* move, some faster than others, they hunt, but the fascination comes in the fact that we're used to wildlife action coming on four legs, it is an alien world when shown properly, but we live in it, it isn't a fictional fantasy creation.

It does, in episodes 6 and 7 go past 1931 (Episode 6 is 1929-1941 and Episode 7 is 1945-Present). All of the historians, writers and others that provide commentary for the film are wonderful and insightful, although they sometimes become repetitive. This is rare, however, and the great stills (and later film) carries the story along from its humble Dutch beginnings in 1609 all the way to the present day. New York is like nowhere else in the world; it is an entity unto itself. But, as F. Scott Fitzgerald notes, it is just a city and not a universe. But what a city. David Ogden Stiers does an incredible job narrating what is, in my humble opinion, the singular film about the history of New York.",

Get your hands on the DVD.

Saw some, weren't that impressed?  Get your hands on the DVD.

Loved it?  Well, you don't need convincing.

Fox did an incredible disservice to this show by showing the episodes out of order.  They still made sense on a very low level, i.e., there weren't a lot of plot points that were part of the continuing arc that ended up being out of order in the order they were aired, but this show is so much better if you see it in the order intended.  In the aired episodes, characters would sometimes do things that either seemed out of character or really weird, or sometimes even just boring, that make so much more sense on the DVDs, even though there's a grand total of one scene (and only about 3 lines of that scene) that's different between the DVD and the aired version.

That said, this show is the most innovative thing I've ever seen on TV, even despite its mistreatment.  It has nine main characters, all of which are fairly well developed in the pilot episode, who then grow and change but remain true to their characters as originally conceived throughout the rest of the series.  I could talk about the incredible attention to detail for the special effects, etc., but special effects are getting really good, so that doesn't really set this apart from a lot of movies out there.  The concept seems odd at first, but is amazingly well done, with each world they go to having its own quirks, charms and dangers, but it always comes back to the characters and their relationships with each other.",

It's the halfway point of the series. The main characters story really does end there. But to show some moral lessons they put in another half to show that ""good through evil isn't good"". All world governments and empires disagree with this, so why did this show have to forcefully fabricate new stories in the second half. It totally ruined it. It takes away from the characters that had been established.

Due to the first half being the best thing I have ever ever seen, I give this 9 stars. Even though the second half was so bad I should reduce it to 5 stars.",

Laurence Oliver's ominous Macbeth style of narration set the tone and the 26 episode series covered WW II really well. Critics point out that it showed the war from more of a British point of view. I suppose the fact that Britain and it's dominions were fighting against the Germans and the Japanese for longer than any of the other allies in the Far East, North Africa, the Mediterranean, the Atlantic, Scandinavia and continental Europe is perhaps understandable. If casualties alone was the standard used to measure sacrifice or relevance then the USSR could lay claim to that . Over 15 % of it's population in some form of another perished in the eastern front amounting to millions in a war of annihilation against the Germans. Taking it on it's own I don't think there is a conflict in human history that can match the brutality and barbarism that took millions of lives in such a short space of time. They are all important topics in the context of WW II and they have over the years been excellently covered and narrated by American as well as British production companies. One aspect that has not been really been examined thoroughly is the WW II purely from an American point of view.

Ken Burns probably needed to remind a new generation of Americans whose understanding of war is limited to computer games and watching smart bombs and predator drones on TV or on you-tube bombarding specs on the ground from a command center in Florida. In previous wars, Americans endured greater sacrifices. A lot of boots on the ground was the order of the day and American troops encountered huge numbers of well armed and fanatical opponents. Interestingly Burns seemed to focus on four states of the USA, Connecticut, Alabama, Wisconsin and California. I don't know why he picked these these in particular, but probably because it gave a good geographical balance of how it affected the lives of the families and the servicemen in the USA.

There is no doubt that mainland USA protected by the vast Atlantic and Pacific oceans had an easier time in WW II than the other allies. The US was never really under a serious threat of either large air raids or invasion. Yes crude attacks were attempted both by the Germans and Japanese but only for propaganda purposes. If it was an accident of geography (and the isolation explains the USA's late entry into the war) lucky for the USA and lucky for the world too! Remember it was a world war and the arsenal of democracy as it was known could offer vital military equipment and manpower for the war effort.

From a standing start,(although lend lease to Britain and armament production had been steadily rising since 1940) the USA really got it's industry going on a total war footing. Japan and Germany had a ten year head start in war capacity and training. By 1942 Americans were fighting in North Africa, by 1943 Italy, 1944 France ,as well as doing a bit of island hopping in the pacific to boot and by 1945 it was all over. In fact Americas limitless natural resources, raw materials, manpower (and woman power) and huge industrial potential uninterrupted from air raids were vital. Not only was it important for victory but also in shaping the post-war world, i.e. the Marshall plan. Americas efforts in the aftermath of the war with European and Japanese reconstruction should not be underestimated. 

The American military with their self confidence, bold ideas, optimism and big band music and might have irritated and annoyed the other allies. In Britain they were over sexed, over paid and over there. However, amusing that might sound it doesn't really go anywhere in telling the whole story. On the cover of this DVD set there is a photograph of a tired and gaunt looking American GI, a far cry from the beaming soldier fresh off the boat in the snazzy uniform out on the town. He could have been from any where in the USA perhaps Connecticut or Wisconsin, but his haunted face tells the story. He was probably in his early 20's wanted to go college or get married, join his fathers business, work on the farm or be a lawyer, perhaps he wanted to be a baseball player. Yet his life was turned upside down, conscripted into the service and after boot camp was shipped off thousands of miles from where he grew up to places he had never heard of! 

American blood was spilled as far and wide as Iwo Jima, North Africa, Normandy, Bastogne and Guadalcanal, Anzio, Remargen and Midway, just to name a few, ten of thousands of Americans died on land in the air and at sea. American forces were involved in some of the most vicious fighting of the second world war. Victory over Hitler nor Japan could have been achieved without US participation, but the USA couldn't have done it all alone too, allies were vital too.

It gives an interesting account of the war from how it impacted the lives of Americans and how they saw it from their point of view. I got the impression from Burns that the US fought harder in the pacific, it was more personal, probably because of pearl harbor but moreover the Japanese were really easy to hate, they were exceptionally cruel to their captives. Well narrated in an easy going style by Keith David. Must movies for Americans to watch after this is THE VICTORS 1963 and finally the very impressive BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES 1949.",

'Behind the Scenes' stuff, which is in-between the performances, shows all the things the band deals with while on their 2006 Euro tour - on this DVD while in Italy(all the 5 concerts). That's what makes this a real pearl among the other Pearl Jam DVD's. Not only that we get great performances here (16 songs overall - 13 regular set-list pieces + 3 bonuses - amazing) but we also see the band members living their lives on tour. Because of that this DVD movie has a very personal feel attached to it.

If you never picked up a Pearl Jam DVD before and you have never seen any performance by them live or on DVD then i suggest to get this one. Touring Band 2000 is also amazing if you look for music-performances-only DVD.

Recommended for every rock music fan in general cause Pearl Jam is one of the few rock bands that matter nowadays, a touring force that sells-out arenas & still creating a music that is vital and fresh & maybe the most important - a band with conscience.",

He may apparently dislike the term, but it is hard to not say that about such a great presenter who has contributed significantly to some of the best programmes (of the documentary genre and overall) the BBC has ever aired/produced.

It is really hard picking favourites, let alone a definite favourite, among what Attenborough has done because he has done so many gems, it is the equivalent of trying to choose your favourite ice cream flavour or your favourite operatic role (for examples) and finding you can't pick. To me though, 'Nature's Great Events' is up there with his crowning achievements and one of the best documentaries ever viewed, and as has been said already there are a lot of great ones. It has everything that makes so much of his work so wonderful, hence some of the reiteration of my recent reviews for some of his work (being on a nature documentary binge in my spare time), and deserves everything great that has been said about it.

First and foremost, 'Nature's Great Events' looks amazing. It is gorgeously filmed, done in a completely fluid and natural, sometimes intimate (a great way of connecting even more with the animals), way and never looking static. In fact much of it is remarkably cinematic with some of the shots being unique for a documentary series, making one forget that it is a series. The editing is always succinct and smooth and the scenery is pure magic, similarly really admired the wide-ranging diversity of the different landscapes rather than restricting it to just one habitat. The music score fits very well, never overly grandiose while never being inappropriate.

Again, like so many Attenborough nature/wildlife documentaries, 'Nature's Great Events' fascinates, teaches, moves, entertains and transfixes. In terms of the facts there was a very good mix of the known ones and the unknown, some facts being familiar to us while going into detail about the different animals, their challenges and some truly amazing wildlife events in their struggles for survival and interaction with other animals whether prey or predator.

Narration by Attenborough helps significantly. He clearly knows his stuff and knows what to say and how to say it. He delivers it with his usual richness, soft-spoken enthusiasm and sincerity, never talking down to the viewer and keeping them riveted and wanting to know more. The ""behind the scenes/making of"" scenes too gave some humanity to the series and allowed us to get to know those behind the camera as well as in front.

The animals are big in personality and very diverse. The conflict has genuine tension and suspense, there is some fun and a lot of emotionally powerful moments done with a lot of tear-jerking pathos. Found myself really caring for what we're told. Like much of Attenborough/BBC's other work, each episode doesn't feel like an episodic stringing of scenes, but instead like the best nature documentaries each feels like their own story and journey, with real, complex emotions and conflicts and animal characters developed in a way a human character would in a film but does it better than several.

To conclude, great is far too much of an understatement for such an achievement in nature documentaries. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Inevitable, though some may argue unfair, comparisons may be (have been in fact) made to the output of David Attenborough, to me 'Human Planet' is one of the better documentary series in recent years to not have Attenborough's name on it and stands wonderfully on its own, if just lacking the special magic of Attenborough's best work.

There are so many great things here in 'Human Planet'. Its premise is dealt with exceptionally in every single episode, the environments, how they're lived in, how the humans adapt to the environments, the human struggles and how it all affects the environment are all interesting topics and important ones handled truly admirably. Also in a way that is illuminating but not preachy (which is a potential danger with anything environmental-themed and a danger often fallen into).

When it comes to how it's written, 'Human Planet' does just as good a job entertaining and teaching, it's all very sincerely done and it never feels like a sermon. There are things here that are common sense and knowledge but one is taught a huge deal as well.

John Hurt's (RIP) narration delivery is similarly spot-on, very sensitively delivered and very dignified in a distinctively John Hurt way. Arguments may be made about Attenborough being a much better choice, to me Hurt was perfect and more than held his own and although Attenborough is the master of nature/life documentaries today he can't do every single one made.

Visually, 'Human Planet' may lack the awe-inspiring, almost cinematic quality of Attenborough's best work. With that being said, it is beautifully shot, shot in a fluid, graceful and never static way, and is chock-full of strikingly memorable images. In every episode, the scenery and environments (which include oceans, deserts, the Arctic, jungles, grasslands, rivers and cities) are like characters of their own, they're all gorgeous to look at and have a lot of atmosphere.

Every episode is appropriately scored, never intrusive or too low-key, and the different stories are powerful in a harrowing and poignant way, not to mention very honest.

In summary, exceptionally well-made and educational, well worth watching if just falling short of masterpiece status. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It made quite an impression on me, to be honest I was absolutely spellbound. 

Quite recently I obtained a DVD-release and was somewhat amazed: It was just as good as I remembered it! This is not simply a bad case of nostalgia, this show is definitely something above the ordinary. We might have struck gold here.. 

The show is in nine stand alone episodes based on nine old folktales. (Mostly Russian or German) Not so ""kidified"" as most recent versions, just a little bit cruel, but always with a happy ending (with 2 exceptions) 

The special effects (especially the creature effects ) still look really good even in this time of photo-realistic computer animation. If you take into account that this is a TV-production from 1987 the effects are absolutely outstanding! They give a much more living impression than many computer generated creatures I have seen of late.

The actor performances are maybe not always of academy award winning standard.. but I can live with that, and most probably so can you. Not all nine episodes are masterpieces either, but some come very close to being just that. ""The Soldier and Death"" is in my opinion one of the best and appears to be the first choice of most other reviewers. ""Sapsorrow"" (their version of Cinderella) is also worth mentioning. Maybe not for it's greatness but for the most enjoyable Disney reference. Very amusing. 

When this was aired it had the added title: ""Stories for grown up children"" and that is a good description of what this is. Maybe not for the very youngest but perfect for anyone else. Especially anyone interested in folktales or anything fantasy-like. 

Highly recommended.",

The Moromete Family is a great piece of Romanian cinema, and just a great piece of cinema.

The Story: Centering around a family living Romania, during World War II, as they deal with problems of living in that time. Such as, having trouble paying taxes, trying to get their kids and school, and the war environment. One of the best written films I've ever watched. This film really understands how to write human interactions. The family in the film, feel like a real family going through hard times.

The Characters: The characters in this film, are all relatable and interesting. As they feel just like real people. Everyone acts and talks like real people their age.

The Visual Style: This is a great looking movie. The black and white astetic allows the film to feel more like the time period, and also let's the film look more dark and depressing as a whole.

Simply put, the show is amazing. From the art, to the music, and most importantly, the story line - Cowboy Bebop delivers. Although most reviewers have summed up the storyline fairly well, I'll give a brief overview.

In the not so distant future, many planets have been colonized and huge technological advancements have been made, but enough with the obvious. Two men, Spike and Jet meet up with future comrades Faye and Ed and team up (or fly it solo) to form the most effective bounty hunting team in the universe. Technology benefits both bounty hunter (known as Cowboys) and criminal as the crew of the Bebop Ship try to make an honest Wulong (the futuristic form of currency) while each member encounters shades of their illuminous past.

A huge bondship amongst the characters is felt almost from the start, despite on-going tensions on the Bebop. Furthermore, each character is given at least two whole episodes, which elaborate on their past, which intertwines oddly with the present (an on-going theme in Cowboy Bebop).

Their pasts are as diverse as their personalities and at some points you'll have a hard time even figuring out who the main character is. One is a former worker of a crime syndicate, one a former police officer, one a thief, and the last a computer hacker. Some similarities do exist though, namely stylish outfits and attitudes, but even then, these similarities are VERY few. 

The coolest thing about Cowboy Bebop is it's ability to give you something drastically different each session (don't call it an episode, it's a session). Some sessions wrap you up in action, some make you cry, still some sessions will make you roll on the ground in laughter. One thing for sure is you will get a very satisfying feeling once the credits hit.

The soundtrack for the entire series is another high point. Virtually each session is entangled in some form of sophisticated music, usually Jazz, which is a welcome breeze from the stagnation of today's modern music.

Compared to other anime, Bebop reigns supreme (along with a couple of others), and puts kids shows like Dragon Ball Z (which are virtually plotless in the light of Cowboy Bebop) to shame. This is definitely worth viewing if you're looking for something new to watch, but worried you might just fall victim to another piece of trash reality show or sitcom. Your previous conceptions of anime are about to be shattered.",

Bruno Pelletier who played Gringoire, Garou who played Quasimodo, and last but not least Hélène Ségara who played Esmeralda. Bruno Pelletier's voice was so pure, so pure in fact that I never would have guessed he was singing live. I liked Garou's voice in particular because it was like a modernized rock voice meshed with classical ballads. Hélène's voice was just amazing, her range was endless. The sound of their voices were so good that it literally brought tears to my eyes.

He does so in an entertaining and engaging manner, using archival footage, amateur videos and interviews of great historical and ideological value.

This series is so important and watchable that I expose my students to a few of its most crucial extracts.

Humanity makes a last stand at Minas Tirith, the Hobbits travel through Mordor, our heroes try to by time for Frodo to complete his mission and the Evil Sauron gets tired of the whole game and lashes out with all his might and fury.

""Return of the King"" is 4 hours of payoff, a third act in a gigantic epic rather than a mere film of its own. As such it is intensely dramatic and dynamic and you can very much sense that though peter Jackson spared no effort on the previous episodes, this is clearly his favorite. the film floats by at a thunderous pace, taking us through unforgettable moments such as the battle of Minas Tirith itself, a marvel of seamless animation and epic film-making, it demands to be seen, as it has too many jaw-dropping moments to choose from. The quieter character moments keep gaining in potency and the full weight of the stakes and their heartbreaking consequences is never in doubt.

The cast of these films have played their parts to perfection and again Jackson deserves overall credit for choosing actors that so perfectly match Tlolkien's creations: Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are their own usually excellent selves, and the hobbits remain endearing, but of all the uniformly great cast, the true standouts are Viggo Mortensen and David Wenham as the tragic Faramir, whose relationship with his brutish father is the most traumatic of the film. Jackson pushes them even further by having them sing at a few key moments (a practice employed to powerful effect by Tolkien in the books), a daring undertaking that works wonders. And though he may offer one ending too many, he does have the decency to show off each surviving character with the appropriate screen time and respect.

Now that the trilogy is complete, it can be viewed as one big film, as it should be. After 8 years, Jackson has done the impossible: he has taken Tolkien's huge legend and made films that stand on their own and have revolutionized film-making, setting the new benchmark for cinematic epics. Changes have been made to Tolkien's source novels, but they make for better, more fluid films, more faithful in spirit to Tolkien's myth than anyone had the right to hope for.

Simpson trial. I remember the weird slow-speed police chase of the bronco, which was so peculiar that I couldn't stop watching, but after that I never watched the trial, or read news of the trial, because I barely new who Simpson was and I thought of it as just some salacious celebrity murder case. I had no doubt Simpson was guilty - I mean, he'd gone on the run and been chased down by the cops! - but I didn't have any interest in the process of his being convicted, didn't care about Kato Kaelin or Judge Ito, or any of that.

Then he got off, and it turned out that the case was a huge one about the shocking difference in how white and black America saw U.S. justice.

This documentary puts that trial in context. First, it explains why Simpson was so beloved, portraying his phenomenal sports success and his subsequent celebrity career. It also puts the trial in the context both of the Rodney King beating and of a case I'd never heard of where an Asian woman got no jail time for shooting a black girl in the back of the head.

For white people like me, this was a simple case of a celebrity who savagely murdered his ex. But viewed through the lens of a justice system that seemed built entirely for white people, the trial was something else entirely, and Simpson's pricey lawyers took advantage of that.

The full story of Simpson, from his glory days to his final fall, is like a Shakespeare tragedy, with a shining hero undone by his own darkness. It can also be seen as the story of a cold-stone psychopath who was given a pass for continually beating his wife simply because he was a celebrity with a winning smile.

Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing.  (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.)  Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film.  All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.

The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film.  Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on.  The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling.  Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. 

This movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so.  Immediately.  (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

It's... hilarious. It's... absurd. It's... very hard to describe, because it is so freakin' random! Almost every little sketch takes such bizarre twists and turns into something completely else that you'll literally never see it coming. Terry Gilliam's innovative, and equally absurd, animations are no different in their appearances between sketches. Often serving as transitions, but really this is just one side-splittingly funny compilation of sheer absurdity.

Poking fun at just about everything that you could possibly imagine - talk shows, courts, daily life, the Spanish Inquisistion, the military, etc... - and it is all put together in a way no less random. Skits end unexpectedly, some shots are used many times, random characters appear only to speak one line, and all that makes for what is quite possibly the best crafted presentation of absurdity and chaos ever made. 10/10

Anyone who knew about the private life of Kemal Sunal would know that in his personal life he was a very serious man. His on screen persona's (unfortunately for a lifelong fan such as myself, who had hoped otherwise) were nothing like his own personality. He continues in the role of 'Saban', the surreal, chaotically stupid on screen persona he adopted in many films. His role in this film I wouldn't regard as exaggerated at all, as a matter of opinion, it seems far more toned down in comparison to his performances in, say, the Hababam Sinifi series. I think if anything, Halit Akçatepe's performance as Ramazan spoiled the overall quality of the film, as he forgot he was merely a supporting role and instead tried to outshine Sunal with no real success. As for Sener Sen, he plays the same sturdy supporting role which he does in many films which he played alongside Kemal Sunal, this performance being exemplary. The real great performance aside from Sunal's is without doubt Sevket Altug's minor role as Yunus Kaptan. Its unfortunate that his later works didn't quite meet up to the promise he showed in this film with his madcap naval officer. Special mention also goes to Sevda Aktolga, who understated her role in this film even though she was the object of Saban and Ramazan's affections (though, to be honest, because shes so attractive I used to wish there was more of her in it!). Ultimately, although some people might find influence from other films of the time emulated in this film, to suggest that The Return of Pink Panther was ripped off is absurd, as it really doesn't fit in with the structure of Turkish humour, Overall, Turkish humour is abundant in this film, and an array of original material, highlighted by Kemal Sunal and Sevket Altug, is on show for all to see.",1H30M

This television broadcast made for BBCs Granada Television immortalizes their West End and Broadway success of Harold Pinter's fascinating though impenetrable play about the late night meeting between Hirst, a wealthy man of letters and Spooner, a down-at-heels Bohemian poet, which may represent the finest non-Shakespearean performances of either actors' careers. Particularly memorable is Gielgud, who presents Spooner as a clinging, fawning W. H. Auden-like poser which may be his most effective attempt at portraying a characterization on film outside of the typical stiff and very British Gielgud personae that we've grown accustomed to seeing in films like ""Arthur"" and ""The Elephant Man"".

Richardson is also marvelous as the more mysterious Spooner, who sometimes recalls Harry Meyers in ""City Lights"" as a millionaire who invites a tramp into his privileged world when he's plastered only to forget him when he sobers up, as well as Michael Kitchen and Terence Rigby offering excellent support as Hirst's flunkies. But it is Gielgud's masterful work as a sleazy pretender that creates the greatest impression.

Pinter's fascinating though somewhat baffling play has received some major revivals since its original production, most memorably with Christopher Plummer as Spooner and Jason Robards as Hirst (making his final stage performance) in a 1994 Broadway production and a 1992 London staging starring Pinter himself in the role of Hirst, but the play will forever be identified with Richardson and Gielgud in their final appearance together.

One also has watched a helluva movie. 

Back in the early 80's I called in sick (along with some friends) to see the opening of Petersen's Das Boot. We were all stunned. Went out for a beer and then returned to the theatre and watched it all over again. 

Petersen masterfully developed his cast into a crew who are no longer ""the enemy"" but fresh faced kids, neither prepared nor aware of the horror that was waiting them. When I first saw ""Das Boot""  I was the same age as those kids so it resonated more powerfully than I could have possibly imagined. In this wonderful uncut release of the original German miniseries we're forced to spend even more time with the crew of U-96 and in that time get to knew them better. We see friendships and bonds formed, the irritability that comes with lack of privacy and tension so dense it becomes an almost physical presence. We also get more of the sense of what war really is  immense spans of boredom and ennui interrupted by the occasional horrors of violence and death. 

Petersen kept his cast indoors and unshaven during the entire shoot with the resulting effect that the crew actually looks like a group of men who have not seen natural light, or breathed fresh air for 65 days. Additionally, the actors were all put through vigorous physical training so that when racing through the set of a dangerously reconstructed U-Boat, they move naturally with an almost balletic swiftness that is dazzling. 

This is masterful film-making of the highest order, with sound and lighting that capture the claustrophobic nature of a submarine, almost suffocating the viewer. The scenes of Das Boot racing through the Atlantic, it's difficult near fatal destruction in the narrow Strait of Gibraltar will have your blood pumping at fever pitch.

The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent, each actor - even ones with little to no dialogue, making bold indelible choices in developing their characters. 

Jürgen Prochnow as the Captain gives a remarkable, strong performance, making one believe - from the very beginning - this is a true leader of men.

You have no difficulty believing this crew standing behind this captain's every decision. 

Petersen's writing of Herbert Grönemeyer as the eager young reporter, Werner is a masterful creation. Werner becomes the multi-faceted prism through whom we watch and live this story. Part Greek chorus, part conscience of the uninvolved, we join him as an outsider on the inside, becoming participants in this heart rending drama. Grönemeyer's performance becomes the very soul of Das Boot.

""Das Boot"" remains one of my all time favorite films and to finally be able to own and see it as Wolfgang Petersen intended is one of the best things to happen since the invention of DVD.",

Unique.  Captivating.  Enchanting.

Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen.  And we had nearly three hours to go.

The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth.  And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.

But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.

Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.

The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.

Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year.  George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.

However I was worried that it would be as disappointing as Torchwood, its spin-off. Now that I have seen it all I can say is that my opinion is mixed. Some elements were interesting but overall it felt like a waste of time. In fact beside the story it's also Lindsay Duncan who convinced me to watch the episode as she plays Adelaide Brooke, the new companion. I really liked her character in Rome and her performance was quite good. As expected her talent and charisma shined and without her The Waters of Mars would have been dead dry. I can't even believe she's almost 60 years old because her natural beauty was easy on the eyes. Moreover her character was fierce and strong-minded so she made a believable commander of the first human mission on Mars. However she shadowed the other cast members and revealed the seams of a questionable ensemble cast. I hope the performers were hired for their talent, not the color of their skin.

As terraforming is a recurring and fascinating topic in the scientific news I was expecting something smart and controversial. But the story was predictable and written around sci-fi clichés and questionable ideas. Only after a few minutes I already wanted to switch off my TV because I thought things could only get worse. I should have because most of the time I was bored and only continued to watch the episode because of the Doctor intriguing attitude and Lindsay Duncan. I can accept they had to produce a family friendly episode but I wasn't expecting some scary scenes to be nearly as ridiculous as in Scream and other teen movies. But the worst idea was probably to include the most annoying robot I have ever seen. It even reminded me of Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars. It's like if the writers had found, dusted and followed an ancient book on Disney worst recipes and black creativity.

Otherwise beside Duncan a few elements saved this episode from reaching the deep sea, where plastic bottles find a second life. First even if the story wasn't frightening I have to admit that it succeeded in questioning the morality of terraforming other planets, to feed our desire of conquest and urge to survive our own mistakes. There were also some deep and sad moments between Adelaide and the Doctor. In fact I think some scenes could be relatively disturbing for young viewers. Last but not least watching the Doctor so tortured was surprising because at first he seemed funny and joyful. However when watching him fight his inner demons should have been fascinating it wasn't because the action was sloppy and they waited for the last minutes to make the scenes more dynamic, but the execution only led to chaotic ones. The actor's performance was also over the top. Otherwise the ending was intriguing enough and made me curious about the Doctor. Because with a better story and without the junk following his adventures could be both entertaining and interesting.",

An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?

Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!

But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'

Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a ""forger"" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. 

There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.

Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If ""Inception"" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.

To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! 

My Rating: 10/10

Les Misérables in Concert: The 25th Anniversary,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDcwNTE5MTM0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU5ODczNA@@._V1_.jpg,"Drama,Music,Musical","Alfie Boe,Norm Lewis,Matt Lucas,Jenny Galloway","Nick Morris,Laurence Connor,James Powell","Les Misérables in Concert: The 25th Anniversary is a movie starring Alfie Boe, Norm Lewis, and Matt Lucas. A celebratory 25th anniversary concert performance of the hit musical at The O2 in London.",2010-10-03,"based on stage musical,concert version,live performance",8.8,Mr_PCM,2011-01-13,"Les Miserables is, quite simply, the finest musical ever made, and this special anniversary performance encapsulates exactly why.

It had been many years since I saw 'Les Mis' on stage in London, and other than listening to it on CD semi-regularly, I hadn't had much experience of the show until receiving the 25th anniversary concert on Blu-Ray. Prior to then, 'Phantom' was by a mile my favourite musical, with no others close. Les Miserables blows them all out of the water.

The story is simple enough. A paroled man tries to rebuild his life with adopted daughter Cosette, against the backdrop of student rebellions in France. Meanwhile Marius, one of the students, and Cosette fall in love. Yet the plot is little more than something to drape the music around, and for that it serves its purpose admirably, giving depth, context and emotion to the magnificent music. Much has been written about the plot's simplicity, which needs little more than a couple of captions and video clips to drive it on, and the similarly simple staging also needs little analysis. Both serve to focus all attention on the music, adding to the raw power of the show.

The music ranges from the comedic (Master of the House) to the tragic (On My Own) to the operatic (Bring Him Home) and the simply spine-tingling (One Day More). No other musical has the power to raise hairs and bring goosebumps throughout, and at the same time bring entire audiences to tears – look out during the standing ovation (one of many) towards the end for a lady with mascara streaming down her face from tears, demonstrating the emotional power of the music. In any other musical, ask fans to name their favourite song, and they will usually all pick from the same few. But with Les Miserables, fans would be hard-pressed to limit their choices to a top 10, with 'I Dreamed a Dream', 'Stars', 'Do You Hear The People Sing', 'One Day More', 'On My Own', 'Bring Him Home' and 'Empty Chairs' not even half the regular list of favourites! The casting is near-perfect. Having seen much of the original cast in the 10th anniversary production way back in my school days, and all but worn out the CD of the original cast recording, I never thought anybody could surpass Colm Wilkinson's definitive performance as the hero Valjean. Yet Alfie Boe does that superbly. His vocal range and emotion invested into the music equals that of his legendary predecessor, but he is also able to bring a power and resonance that gives operatic scale and strength to his performance. His dramatic renditions of solos such as 'What Have I Done?' and 'Who Am I?' are spine-chilling, thanks to the strength with which he is able to hit and hold the big notes, while his 'Bring Him Home' is quite simply awesome. Yet he is not alone. Norm Lewis's Javert is virtually his equal in emotional range, and Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras and Katie Hall as Cosette are also excellent. Matt Lucas, in a slightly leftfield casting choice, is surprisingly entertaining as the roguish Thernadier. While never claiming to be a first-rate singer, Lucas makes up for this by enjoying what obviously is a long leash given to him to put his own spin on the character, really hamming up the comical villainy and providing some genuine hilarity amongst all the weepies. Special mention must be made of the performance of Samantha Barks as the feisty Eponine. While Frances Ruffelle was excellent as the original, Samantha Barks sets a new benchmark, bringing a genuine heart-wrenching pitiable quality, leading audiences to virtually want to beat Marius over the head for not seeing her true feelings, and her haunting solo in one of the show's signature songs – On My Own – becomes a real tear-jerker.

Which brings us to Marius. The casting of Nick Jonas, of Jonas Brothers fame, is little more than a casting publicity stunt, and one which almost backfires catastrophically. Quite simply, Jonas is leagues out of his depth, and his voice has not the power nor range to do justice to the role, and he comes across as a typical boy band singer, and a barely adequate one at that. His voice seems small and tinny next to the emotion of Barks or the raw power of Boe. Even his facial expressions come straight from Backstreet Boys 101! He is clearly there as a blatant stunt to draw in younger fans who would buy this just on seeing his name in the cast, a move which comes across as cynical and could cost the performance a star on its own. To be fair to Jonas however, by the time Marius's signature number of 'Empty Chairs at Empty Tables' arrives, he seems to have grown into the part somewhat and sings it reasonably well. Yet when Michael Ball comes onstage for the encore with the rest of the original cast to belt out 'One Day More', you cannot help but feel 'now that is how it should be done!' But even Jonas' potentially disastrous performance cannot prevent this spectacular production of the world's longest running musical from achieving full marks. The music is out of this world, the singing is almost universally phenomenal and the setting of the O2 is suitably grand. It is impossible to fully articulate the raw power of the emotions stirred by the spectacular songs of Les Miserables, but I defy anybody not to be moved to near tears, left breathless and feel a chill throughout the show, and if you are not moved, then you are either lying or dead inside, particularly given the extra treat of seeing the original cast reunite for 'One Day More' and the four Valjeans singing 'Bring Him Home' – a wonderful bonus.

Many musicals encompass a range of emotions, but none run the whole gamut with quite the same power as Les Miserables. Awe-inspiring. Perfect.",2H58M

Pretty much this is the best version I have seen so far! Everyone did a fabulous job at portraying their characters especially Ramin and Sierra. Towards the end of the show, my friend and I completely lost it because of the intense emotions that the two literally put into their characters so well that their performance will tug on your heartstrings. Ramin is by far the best Phantom in my opinion. He blew me away by not just his voice but the emotions he put into his character, showing his character's sensitive side and vulnerability with just a dose of sexuality. I do put him as my favorite above Gerard Butler's Phantom (Gerard was very good in the 2004 movie version, but he didn't have that intense emotion that Ramin has). Sierra was excellent and the best Christine I have seen so far (Emmy Rossum was also very good in the 2004 version, but sounded more classical than operatic to me). Towards the end, Sierra's emotions got the best of me and I did see she fought really hard to stay in character when she sang one last time to the Phantom. I have always been not a fan of Raoul and I still am not,but the guy who played him in this version has an amazing voice and played his character well! I think he exaggerated his performance just a tiny bit, but at least he didn't have an emotional breakdown on stage. For the lady who played Carlotta was hilarious and she is right up there next to Minnie Driver's 2004 version. It was great having Carlotta as the snobbish but sort of comedy reliever that makes the story less intense. All in all, like I said everyone on the stage performed well into their characters and I truly want to see them perform in other Broadway roles as well. Well worth watching on Netflix and be sure to have a box of tissues near you...just in case.",2H17M

With his lens he pairs the natural beauty of the landscape with the tranquility and peace of Lauridsen's music. Early in the film we are taken from Waldron Island, one of the San Juan Islands, and transitioned away from a natural settings of beauty and stillness, to the stunning grand stone architecture of cathedrals. Stillwater makes this transition while maintaining the true softness this film needs and deserves. For me, his use of stain glass windows and sculpture helps create a transition that works. I also liked the opportunity to listening to Lauridsen speaking over his music. I found his voice and his music together stunningly meditative. This film will resonate with many - not just those who are already Lauridsen fans. The film is accessible, informative and best of all beautiful to watch and of course beautiful to listen to.

Zed Zeppelin, the world's original super group and one of the few bands in history who could rival The Beatles for fame and popularity at their height, reformed for a one off concert at London's O2 Arena for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert. The show set a world record for ticket demand with over twenty million people (including myself) registering online for a chance of one of the 20,000 tickets. Like close to twenty million others I didn't get a ticket for a show that myself and other fans had been waiting for, for over twenty five years.

Fast forward nearly five years to October 17th 2012 and the concert was screened for one day worldwide in cinemas ahead of a DVD and Blu Ray release on November 19th. This time demand wasn't so high and I managed to get two tickets for a screening at my local multiplex. While in no way the same as seeing the band, my favourite of all time, live, the two hours I sat in the cinema were amazing. The band showed that despite having barely played together in thirty years and missing original drummer John Bonham whose death in 1980 was the trigger for the band's breakup, that they are still able to rock with the best and sounded close to as good as they have on any other live recording I've seen.

One of the problems with seeing a band like Led Zeppelin at the cinema is that it isn't the sort of environment that you can really relax, sing,air guitar or dance in. It was a little awkward at times as a few people bobbed heads or tapped feet. I didn't feel as though I could properly enjoy the show in that environment and think that it is probably better suited to DVD. I had to resist the urge to sing and clap which isn't the most relaxing thing.

Before I go any further I have to make it clear that I may be biased in my review of this concert film as Led Zeppelin is my favourite band. Even so and trying to be as objective as possible, they put on one hell of a show. The film is shot in a fairly conventional manner with close-ups of faces, instruments and the like, spliced with wide shots and some nice super 8 style camera work which is reminiscent of the likes of The Song Remains the Same and the Led Zeppelin DVD. The old looking footage gives a 70s vibe which obviously matches the music. For the most part the camera-work is crisp and looks great in HD. There are plenty of interesting angles and cuts too which add to the visual enjoyment. Unlike Scorsese's Rolling Stones film Shine a Light which seemed to spend as much time on the audience as the band, Celebration Day focuses almost solely on the on stage action with just a couple of cut aways to the audience.

Musically the band sound incredibly tight. The three surviving members last performed together in 1988 and this was their first full length concert since John Bonham's death. Age and time coupled with a falling out between bassist John Paul Jones and singer Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page appears to have had little effect as the band sound great. Robert Plant's voice is almost indistinguishable from his 1970s self save for a few missed high notes. Jimmy Page is still one of the greatest guitarists of all time and played the concert despite breaking his little finger just a month before the show. John Paul Jones, always the quietest member of the group and the one who seems least at ease on stage played incredibly well on both bass and keyboards. Drummer Jason Bonham, son of John was excellent and has all the ferocity of his father. He slotted straight in despite this being the first gig he'd played with the full band. Not a bad debut gig! It was nice to witness the genuine looks of pride and glee on the faces of the original members as the looked a Bonham Jnr playing his father's parts.

In their eleven year existence Led Zeppelin created some of the most iconic rock music in history with the likes of Whole Lotta Love, Kashmir, Rock and Roll and Dazed and Confused amongst the most popular and enduring songs in rock history. Stairway to Heaven of course transcends even those songs and is frequently voted the most popular song of all time, rock or otherwise. As well as the stalwarts like Kashmir and Stairway the band also perform some of my personal favourites such as No Quarter, Misty Mountain Hop and Trampled Underfoot, a song that always reminds me of my dad. For Your Life is also performed on stage for the first time ever but unfortunately there is no space for more of my favourites such as Communication Breakdown, When the Levee Breaks, Heartbreaker, The Immigrant Song, Gallows Pole or Ramble On. The problem with having such an extensive back catalogue is that there will always be songs that are missed but there could be few arguments that the chosen set was anything but spectacular.

Overall Celebration Day is the sort of thing which is probably more enjoyable at home where you can sit back, enjoy a drink or a smoke and properly rock out to the music. Even so I really enjoyed seeing my favourite band on the big screen and would recommend the forthcoming DVD to hard line fans as well as anyone who just thinks that Zeppelin are some old band what sang that long song. There's enough to satisfy fans and newcomers alike.

This documentary can make a person who does not know anything about The Roosevelt Dynasty into an expert in an entertaining and educational way. 

This film has a fine feel of history supported by a very clear narration. The documentary covers facts that take place between 1858 and 1962. The subjects are mainly Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt and their entire lives from birth to death and everything in between. 

The Roosevelts: An Intimate History is a wonderful look at the history of one of the greatest American Dynasties. I love the way they make some parts narrated as if a person from that era is talking. The only thing I have a small problem is the length. The entire thing is 14 hours long. This may be a bit challenging if you try to keep attention of younger audience but, if you stay with it, the film teaches you a lot about history. If you have the time, it is a great film to watch and learn from. 

My favorite scene is when they talk about the birth of Theodore. He is sickly and is not expected to live long. However, he lives a very good and successful life even though every time he sees a doctor they say he has very little time left. He refuses to live with those limitations and to avoid stairs, hard hikes or anything challenging and he lives life to its fullest despite his sickness.

This film is very mature and talks about some touchy topics so I would recommend it for ages 12 to18. Younger kids may get confused of some things. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars for fantastic narration, wonderful layout and a fantastic educational background. After all Ken Burns wrote the book on documentaries! If you like learning about history – this is the way to go.

Speaking of the world may I mention that it has two great things going for it (and these two things blend well together). One: it takes aspects form the 1700's, 1800's and early 1900's and Two: this fantasy world is American. I'm not some horn tooting nephew of Uncle Sam, but I am proud to see any show or animation really take advantage of 350 odd some years of ""American"" (Europeans in America) history, music, culture and atmosphere. This can add to the creep factor, but also grows on you. This show feels like it was made by an American Hayao Miyazaki; in the same way HM uses his Japanese culture to heighten the world. The magic and old time world in this show and Hayao's worlds are so familiar in a completely different way. Plus the two have old women with giant heads, spirits, magic, nature, human like frogs, adventure, strong females, and young protagonists in a fairytale environment. The world actually feels like the ""Frog and Toad"" books I read as a child. 

Don't let me forget that this show is also a musical in a sense. As many cartoons do now (I'm looking at you Adventure Time) the characters sing in every episode, accompanied by fantastic music (that matches the various American eras), and I quite enjoy the opening song as well. 

The voice acting is superb with Elijah Wood, an actual child (which I appreciate in animation) by the name of Collin Dean, and Melanie Lynesky taking center stage. Yet Christopher Lloyd and many others provide there talents too. The characters themselves are very real and multidimensional. Wirt is one of the best heroes in a long time, with a fantastic arc and a very unsure demeanor, Greg (his brother) is an adorable, optimistic and surprisingly bright boy who lives in his own cute little world, but not so cute that he doesn't also live in the real world, and Beatrice is a sassy, brave and loyal friend. I also like the clean character designs, I mean they're simple but also fluid, fresh and different. 

I don't want to spoil any part of the story, but I will say all your questions are answered and everything wraps up beautifully. The episodes are unique but they are all touched upon again, connect, and add to this singular plot. Sometimes you will start somewhere unexpectedly new (or rather without precise context) and this can be disconcerting, yet it does make sense. And more importantly the episode will start somewhere and stay somewhere, 11 minutes never flew by so quickly on a river ferry or a grammar school (the music also contributes to the speed of the episodes). Nod of course to writers: Tom Herpich, Amalia Levari, and Patrick McHale. Also the director Nate Cash (this show also has great directing) 

Over the Garden Wall is so great, and I'm writing this right after finishing the show, that's how great it is. It is dark and bizarre at times (not too dark for most children), but it is also a true adventure with lots of light and hope inside bleakness. And it is the perfect blend of real and surreal that fantasy deserves, there's plenty wacko s@#$ but the story and motives aren't wacko. By episode 2 I was definitely hooked, and by episode 6 I was pretty sure it was going to get my 10/10. I had some doubts with episode 8, yet I was won over during the episode and of course with the show's end. An end that perfectly wraps up everything in a neat bow. Episode 9's ""surprise"" is also so exciting and sets up the tenth to be a sort of finale, but again this is really just a movie, and its so short that there is no fear that one wouldn't finish it and consequently love it.

And that's its beauty and why it is a ten starred masterpiece. Kids movies are very rarely so, long, weird, and have such a unique flow (and all the other great stuff from earlier), children's shows will have extra stories and characters than they often need (and again not have all that stuff from earlier). This is like the ""True Detective"" of children's animated television shows. And the world, oh my gosh the world, I know I already talked about this but whatever. I've just never seen anything like this, and when you wrap all these great elements together you get a perfect show. I recommend everyone see this show and I will be going back over the Garden Wall very soon, to enjoy it even more...

p.s I forgot to mention it's funny too",

There is the influence of nationalism. If you have big expectations, you will be disappointed. If we vote worldwide, this movie 7,5/10 (Ok, OK... Still a little bit of nationalism ^^), but if we vote for Turkish cinema, this movie 9/10. This is a great, and different job for Turkish cinema. Apart from that, it's a classic war movie with some stereotypes, that's all. Don't expect anything different.

Yes, Dag II(Mountain II) a nice war movie. But, don't compare with American war movies that cost 100 million dollar. That would be unfair. Because, Dag II's budget 2.000.000 Turkish Lira, it means ~550.000 dollar. But, Dag II is the best job that can be done with this budget. 

Explosion effects can be better but passable(budget). Uniforms, weapons, equipment are real, taken from Turkish Armed Forces. 

The movie is starting perfectly. The action is perfect in the second half. The conflict scenes were pretty good.

Dag II isn't like the first movie. The Dag was a struggle for survival. But Dag II a heroic story. Dag II is a different and much bigger movie. These guys are specially trained to kill but they aren't emotionless machines. Dag II shows this very well. They stay in dilemma, do the right thing, or just do your task. It's a tough decision and it can change a lot of things.

I can not wait for Dag III. With a much larger budget, as a bigger movie. 

Also, if you want to watch another military movie from Turkish cinema, you should watch ""Nefes: Vatan Sagolsun"". There is a different, emotional and very impressive theme.",2H15M

Those names would be John Cleese and Ricky Gervais. While Gervais recently found comedy through his program called 'The Office', Cleese has been providing wit, wisdom, and down-right hysteria for the past several decades. While away from his namesake (Monty Python), you can find Cleese comfortable in several other roles that showcase his bubbling talent. One of those programs just happens to be the funniest bit of crumpet called 'Fawlty Towers'. 

Remembering this show when I was a child and was on our local PBS station, I eagerly bought it when it was released on DVD about a year ago. Since then, I have watched random episodes here and there but never fully taking in the enjoyment from watching it all. So, today I decided to sit down and watch this series from beginning to end and I have yet to finish laughing. If this program doesn't define comic genius, I don't know what does. Never have I witnessed a show that has continually been fresh, hysterical (I cannot use that word enough), real, and outlandish all at the same time. Normally, with our current television programming, you need to pick or choose which it will be, but thankfully 'Fawlty Towers' is all of these and many more. 

Cleese remains in top form as Basil Fawlty, the owner/manager of the B&B that just happens to have his hands and over-worked imagination in everything. With the aid of his helpers Manuel (he's from Barcelona) and Polly (co-writer Connie Booth and ex-wife of Cleese), Cleese always seems to find himself in a heap of trouble with his wife Sybil (the dragon of the hotel). Armed with physical humor and a snake-like banter, we witness everything from a dead body, hotel inspectors, a failed anniversary party, a moose head, and a Himalayan rodent of sorts happen to this simple, everyday, B&B. This is not only a few of the episodes you will find in the complete set, but also the daily stress that Basil finds himself falling into daily.

This series, again, is hysterical. Cleese is the master of his trade while proving that he can manage any task thrown in front of him. While some will argue that he overshadows the rest of the cast, I would say 'hogwash' to that. My two favorite characters in this series were Major and Manuel. The comedy that they provide cannot be found on television today. All I need to say is thank God for the BBC.

Just think about Larry Flynt in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or Andy Kaufman in ""Man on the Moon"", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.

The movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn't mean that the movie isn't filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a 'wonderful' ending which I'm not going to spoil.

Yes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie. It was a really Oscar worthy performances, which he also received. Another Oscar winner for her performance was Louise Fletcher, which in my opinion is a bit too much credit. She plays her role well but nothing more than that. She did not deeply impressed me or anything. This movie also marks the debut for some today well known actors such as Danny DeVito (he looked so young and different!), Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif, who also received an Oscar nomination.

Really one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life.

The great strengths of I, CLAUDIUS are in the driving pace, sharp wit, and ferocity of Jack Pulman's script and the host of brilliant performers who play it out. Chief among these are Sian Phillips as the calculating, murderous, and unspeakably cold Livia, wife of Augustus; although Derek Jacobi gives a justly famous performance in the title role, it is Phillips who dominates and drives the story with this, the most brilliant performance of her career. But this is not to disparage the overall cast, which is remarkably fine and includes such noted artists as Brian Blessed, John Hurt, Patricia Quinn, Patrick Stewart, and a host of others.

Like the serpent that appears in the open credits, the story twists and winds--and covers several generations of the ruling family as Rome slips from the republic to royal rule, largely due to the manipulations of Livia, who has few if any scruples in her determination to rule first through her husband and then through her son. Although the look of the film is somewhat dated, it in no way impairs the power of the piece, and I, CLAUDIUS remains one of the handful of miniseries that actually improves upon repeated viewings. Strongly, strongly recommended.

Many of the characters, motives and stories are based on reality. The main story line - the concept trial of minister Daniel and his group is about the concept trial of communist leader and minister Rajk. He was an ideologist communist and they said that he could be the next leader of Hungary after Rakosi who was the Stalinist leader of Hungary between 1949 and 1956. Rajk had different ideas than Rakosi on many questions. He got apprehended in 1949. He had a public trial where everything was pre-arranged. The false accusation and the testimonies of the witnesses were written by Rákosi's administration and Moscow. The witnesses were prepared and trained by the ÁVH (Hungarian KGB). Many intellectuals actually did believe in communism but after the Rajk trial and the mystic disappearance of people on a mass scale showed everyone the true face of the Rákosi regime. It was very uncertain whether Bacsó can make the film at all. The party made some suggestions. For example the original script referred to the traitor Daniel as the ""Daniel gang"" like Rajk and his friends were called the ""Rajk gang"". The censors asked Bacsó to alter the term ""gang"" to ""group"" as the term gang was a too clear reference to Rajk.

The characters: - There was a major party member and army general who was the model of comrade Bástya. - Comrade Virág was based on the much feared ÁVH leader Péter Gábor. ÁVH did took a lot of people from their homes in the middle of the night in black, curtained cars. They tried to convince and break people by being both brutal and nice. Comrade Virág uses all kind of methods to drive Pelikán to be the key witness. Also the clothes of the ÁVH agents are very much like the real and Virág's room has many references how some party leaders were thinking and living.

Pelikán's jobs: - Swimming pool: There was a major party member who used to get one of Budapest's major swimming pools emptied when he wanted to swim. This comrade kept this habit even in the seventies. - Theme park: The original name of the Hungarian theme park was really English Park that has changed sometime in the Rákosi regime. Also the scenic railway really had a communist version where they showed how the society evolved (according to Engels' theory). - Hungarian orange: It is true that Hungarians wanted to grow orange in Hungary. The project was launched by Rákosi himself.

There are also a lot of references in the movie to real persons and events most of which can be understood by the ones actually lived in Hungary in the 50's. Bacsó said that the last scene where comrade Virág and Pelikán met on the tram and the tram door closed very much resembled the days when the film was made. Although the Stalinist Rákosi regime was over the and the prisoners of the 50's and their guards were still there. They traveled on the closed tram together like fishes in an aquarium.",1H45M

However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.

Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series.  However what gets added to that is a much darker strand.  The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact.  This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion.  In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.

Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company.  The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett.  The two work well together and come together well for a great finale.  The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.

The characters are better here than the first.  The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here.  However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi.  Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.

Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better.  Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising.  All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date.",2H4M

Not before or since has one single piece of film illuminated, exploited or underscored MJ's incredible talent or the more ""otherworldly"" aspects of his persona quite like THRILLER, the world's most successful (if not officially the first) long-form video, and the most fondly remembered. Also the most expensive at the time, but every penny and every bit of the talent behind its creation and execution is up there on the screen. And how would it not be complete without the ""rap"" from the original song, provided by the late, great Vincent Price, to add even more cache to the chills already there? 

The glory days of one of the world's greatest performers have long since passed, but no one can ever take away the man's towering achievements, of which this is probably the most memorable.

This is what (television) drama should be. I saw the first Heimat when it was broadcast in the Netherlands in 1985, shortly after it was released in Germany. I was stunned. It seems that every decade one or two television productions excel, and this was without a shred of a doubt the eighties' highlight. When the second Heimat was shown on Dutch television in two marathon sessions (it runs for over 25 hours in all) I sort of locked myself in, and never regretted it.

I cannot begin to describe what Heimat is about. It's an epos. It's European history of the twentieth century on a small scale, literally. It's 'roman fleuve' and yet it's not. It's your family, that sometimes you wished wasn't there (and for good reasons) and then you're glad to meet again. It's all the human frailty and without the excuses. It *is* the human condition. And it only helps that it is beautifully shot, that the actors put on a superb show, that the music at times is haunting.

Now, on the verge of having the third series shown on TV, the first Heimat is finally available on DVD (with the other two series promised for the next few months). And although I saw most of it about twenty years ago, it is like coming home again and meeting your boyhood friends, those favourite aunts, that dear old uncle - what was wrong with him, again?

If you are looking for action, a thrilling plot, romance in a grand manner, wonderful CGI, and be done before dinner, don't look at Heimat. But if your willing to submerge yourself, to be engulfed by a very good story, to get really, I mean really, well acquainted with characters - well, I'm not in for commercial breaks, but go out and get it!",

Keaton had begun with his parents in a lively, knockabout vaudeville act (literally his father threw him about the stage). When he entered movies it was with Fatty Arbuckle's company, and as Arbuckle's friend and admirer. Unlike most silent performers, Keaton was interested about how movies were made, and actually took apart a camera to study it's workings. He learned to build jokes into his films to develop character. And he never lost his fascination with the power of what films could do. Look at a film like SHERLOCK JR., where he carefully spends time using cutting to make a series of improbable events occur on screen (such as jumping through the chest of a man standing in front of a wall). Chaplin plucks at the heartstrings, Lloyd takes ordinariness and perks it up with dangers, but Keaton is concerned on how man is at the mercy of nature and science. In one long sequence joke in OUR HOSPITALITY, Keaton is being chased to a waterfall set of cliffs. He ties himself to a rope hoping to climb up. An enemy finds the rope and ties it to himself, planning to surprise Keaton when he climbs up. Keaton sees this and yanks on the rope causing his enemy to fall off the top of the cliff into the waterfall, but as the body of the man fall down in the background, Keaton realizes the rope is still tied securely to his own body. Looking stoically into the camera and waiting, a moment later we see Keaton pulled off the screen by the falling body of his enemy. He can fight human enemies, but not the law of gravity.

Keaton did well until 1928, but then family and health problems hit him, especially his growing alcoholism. Stripped of his dignity by a studio boss (Louis B. Mayer) who had no time for has-beens, he became a gag writer. But he still occasionally made films in the sound period. The film shows how Keaton's rise occurred in the 1950s, spurred on by the rediscovery of many of his films. It is a remarkable story of a gifted genius who lived long enough to know he was not a drunken failure but universally admired.",

The story is a biting satire of Soviet communism and even when it was released it would have packed a punch, in fact it was surely art like this and other cultural dissent, not Ronald Reagan and Gorby that dismissed the regime, just a year later. 

The plot involves a slightly uncouth mongrel dog but ever so charming that undergoes an experiment that the Bolshevik-hating professor didn't bargain for....

It comes to no surprise to anyone who has seen Carlin on stage that he isn't one to shy away from telling it like it is for better or for worse. He begins his routine by immediately going political: about the Persian Gulf War, he says, ""It's first war we've had that was on every news channel, plus cable. We like war because we're a war-like people (...) We're good at it. And it's a good thing we are, we're not very good at anything else anymore!"" With this he begins his attack on how we as a nation can bomb other countries, especially ""brown people"" (except Germans, and only because they were trying to 'cut in on our action.'). He talks about being his own person, someone who thinks for himself, and about how war is about ""prick-waving"" and nothing else. And seeing it today as yesterday it makes sense: all he's pointing the finger at is on the general situation and where we're headed, and no one is better than he in making war as a concept a sexual thing and an issue of manhood.

But he soon gets the political stuff out of the way, and goes into dissertations on embarrassing situations -- the trivial things we go through -- which are flat-out funny. No one better than Carlin to talk about how when there are times when you're coming up the stairs and think there is one extra step, or when you've woken up and not known which day it was. And of course, his forte: language, and our misuse or over use of it for things that don't need such technicality. Who better than he to talk about the minutiae of airplane instructions? Carlin, with his wonderful language and powerful wit, makes it happen. Often, it's funny, sometimes, a little cringe-inducing, but give me someone who does not like his humor and his incursions into the darker side of humanity and I will give you a liar.

The one thing that I especially liked about the ""Rock With You"" video (which came from Michael's first solo venture, 1979's Off The Wall) was that it was a very plain and simple presentation featuring a 21-year-old Michael on his own without all of the elaborate choreography (that borrowed so heavily from the movie ""West Side Story"") which seemed to dominate far too many of his later music-videos.

Yes. I'll gladly admit that I'm not much of a Michael Jackson fan. But, with that said - After watching these 10 music videos, I can definitely understand Jackson's vast appeal and popularity.

As a high-energy entertainer and pop music icon, Michael Jackson certainly had something of a special gift. And, as was clearly evident in a number of these music videos, when this dude was good, he was, indeed, nothing short of being sensational.",

Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.

This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).

Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...

A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.

Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.

Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.

If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.

Did this movie have any story at all? First of all is it a movie? No. Anbe Sivam is an experience, not only for one Madhavan but for another few thousands, who care to learn quite a lot of things and feel conceited about themselves, but fail miserably to confront the vagaries of life. What was the movie all about? An experienced matured man and a squeamish, egotist but tender hearted youth (a typical modern day youth) travelling together from Bhubaneshwar to Chennai(East coast of India).Fate hinders their journey in all possible ways which Madhavan initially considers exasperating but later reveres as an experience of a lifetime. The story is as simple as that but the associated scenes,dialogues and the lessons learnt reverberate through your mind for a long time.

Be it the floods,train accident or the little boy's death it is Madhavan who breaks down and get shattered. But Kamalhassan adapts himself and reconciles himself to reality and helps in the best possible way he can. While it takes a lot of effort for Madhavan to tell Kamalhaasan about his fraternal love towards him, Kamalhaasan finds it easy to tell 'A.Ars, you are a go(o)d man' (it's not that easy to tell it to someone earnestly). From where did Kamal get this maturity? The story moves into the flashback of Kamal,a communist, who loves the daughter of a capitalist, Nasser, whom he opposes as a worker regarding wages. When the duo decide to elope to Kerala for marriage, their bus meets with a gory accident. Kamal is badly bruised losing a limb and is totally disfigured. While struggling in bed for life, Nasser speaks extremely rude and blatant to Kamal. On conjuring up the scenes after the accident, he evaluates stark contrast of Nasser and the sister. Kamal sees god through the sister and sees it subsequently in quite a lot of people who propagate love.His outlook changes completely. 

The first half with some lighter moments, the middle with some interesting dialogues and the last with some really shaking scenes Anbe Sivam stands tall amidst other usual Tamil movies. Madhavan is extraordinary communicating the emotions powerfully(especially in the climax dialogue with Kamalhaasan). The one fight scene in the middle could have been avoided. Rather than going abroad for shooting songs, this movie has brought out some really excellent locations in India( not only in machi machi song). The choice of season to shoot this movie has been brilliant with the monsoon accentuating the kind of feelings to be conveyed. Does the name 'Anbe Sivam' mean 'Anbarase Nallasivam' trying to say 'All are one soul'? Kamal only knows. Finally, I'm sure it would not take any effort for anyone who has seen this movie to say 'I love you Dr.Kamalhaasan' for such an excellent story and screenplay.",2H40M

It would be the rare person that would not be reached by this movie. To them I say, ""Cheer up, The Simpsons are on soon!"" I have personally experienced so much of what is covered in the movie -- working outside (on the railway) in 40 below zero weather, hand logging (with my father growing up) and exposure to raw wilderness (I grew up in British Columbia).

It is an important and informative film, fueled by horrific images captured through an unflinching camera lens.

Go into this expecting to be overwhelmed by what you are going to see. I have seen images from the holocaust and the rape of Nangjing and read stories of torture from WW2 and these are frighteningly similar. Much to my surprise it is never preachy - nor does it need to be. The nightmarish images, which to my mind resemble a reasonable facsimile of Hell itself, with the innocent being tortured by their evil overlords, are more than enough. Evil is not the only word that comes to mind when you hear what the workers and trainers say to their sorry subjects as they inflict their torture. But I do not hate the evil men, I somehow pity them, both for the lives they lead and their loss of something I deeply value - empathy and compassion.

What makes Earthlings so powerfully convincing is actually quite simple if you believe that inflicting pain and suffering on an innocent living being is wrong. This kind of suffering could be the result of something as simple as not spaying/neutering your pet. Unfortunately as history shows us, we have a lot to learn about how to treat each other, let alone the animals that share our world. Earthlings gives voice to those that are powerless and cannot speak out on their own behalf.

The film makes a strong argument for some form of compromise on the meat eater/vegetarian debate, but it also delves into the issue of fur trading, animals as a form of entertainment (ie zoos), and as test subjects in the name of science. The footage in each segment is nothing short of incredible and is surely the result of years of effort, on the shoulders of many impassioned individuals, in order to be collected. To those who contributed to this effort, I salute you.

Its true that Earthlings does not offer solutions to all of the problems it seeks to expose. Nor could it hope to do so. The viewer is challenged to seek their own answers and carry the voice of the voiceless to the lawmakers. I can only hope that more people see this and make changes in how they live their lives, and the laws that govern the treatment of animals. The devastating reality is that this potentially life-changing documentary contains only a microscopic portion of what is happening every single day, in every single country, around the world. 

This is a must see and should be required viewing in high school classrooms. In case you decide not to watch Earthlings, particularly if it is because you believe animals are ignorant and don't deserve to be treated humanely, I want you to know that ignorance is NOT bliss if you walk on four legs.",1H35M

The main difference is the amount of color and gruesome scenes in ""WWII In HD"" and the amount of time devoted to the home front in ""Ken Burns' The War."" Other than that, both offer a very emotional ride. The amount of amazing stories that come out of World War II seem limitless.

The most striking thing about this series (1) was all the color photography; (2) were all the gruesome scenes of mutilated, dead bodies and men clinging to life; (3) the emphasis on the Pacific Theater. I really appreciated the latter because this all the intense and brutal battles on those Pacific islands have never gotten ""the play"" the European Theater has received via movies, TV shows and documentaries. Far more people know all about Hilter and his Nazi regime than they do about exactly what went on in places like Tarawa, Saipan, Tinian, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, Okinawa and other islands. The carnage and what happened in those places was unbelievable to me. This program did an amazing job of education us on that key element of World War II.

This is a fascinating documentary by Andrew Jarecki, who also directed ""Capturing the Friedmans (2003)"" - one of the best court documentaries I've ever seen. It also tells the real life story of the man on which the movie ""All Good Things (2010)"", also directed by Jarecki, is loosely based.

Like in two other amazing investigation/court documentaries - those about serial killer Aileen Wuornos and the West Memphis Three - this is another example where the filmmaker finds himself getting involved in the story and having a direct and major affect on the case.

If you haven't heard about this in the news, you might want to avoid reading about the case before watching the documentary - although I did read about it (and then recalled the news several months ago) and it didn't spoil the fascination of watching it.

The documentary follows the life of Robert Durst, who is the son of the late Seymour Durst, one of New York's richest real estate investors and developers. For years Robert has been suspected of killing 3 people: His wife, his female friend, and his neighbor. However, he always managed to ""walk between the drops without getting wet"".

The film has tons of material, showing old footage, evidence, interviews with the people, reenactment of events, actual footage from court,and amazing of all - interviews and full cooperation from Robert Durst himself.

Each episode focuses mainly on one thing. Starting from episode 4 you'll be glued to your chair. Episode 5 is where the filmmakers themselves are getting into their own documentary and becoming a part of it. I don't want to ""spoil"" anything for you, but episode 6 is simply amazing. You can't invent stuff like that. The very last minute is simply something that is taken from the movies.",

As Woody Allen did in Annie Hall (though that was twenty-four years later), the filmmakers here create that acknowledgment of there being an audience- and, more amusingly, their acknowledgment of themselves being apart of the process. I'm certain there were other animated shorts from Looney Tunes where a character may have one or twice looked at the 'audience' and asked a question or said a joke, but I'm also certain it wasn't done to such a length as this. Quite possibly, this is one of the greatest one-joke/in-joke stretches ever put on film.

At the start, Daffy Duck thinks he's about to be in a piece as a musketeer- that is, until the background is pulled right out from under him. He'll never get back to that background again, but Daffy will keep on trying to persuade the animator to bring back some sense into the works. By the end he's exasperated, and the joke comes full circle to be totally satisfying.

Throughout the short what keeps it so funny on repeat viewings is that the absurdities of each new backdrop and each run-in Daffy keep their validity. There's a lot of creative juice flowing through this one, and since the turns are unexpected on the first viewing, on the following ones you laugh at yourself for laughing at it again. Another plus is that Daffy Duck is a superb character when he's kept on his toes- like when he's put against a city backdrop that looks like it was drawn by a five-year old. He asks, ""Now, how about some color, stupid!"" And then is painted over in bizarre hues. The joke that follows that is one of Chuck Jones' most surreal executions. 

Overall, a classic for its time, influential; on a level that will perhaps get the adults laughing more so than the kids, and for those in youth who discover it for the first time on TV or on the new DVD, it isn't old- this is the kind of sense of humor found on other modern cartoons (Simpsons, for example).",7M

The story has become quite influential to filmmakers from the likes of John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) to John Lasseter (A Bug's Life): a small village has been terrorized by bandits for far too long, amid times of civil war in the nation, and so on the advice of Grand-Dad, they decide to hire four - which soon becomes seven - samurai for the job. There's no money, just food and honor, even though the village isn't exactly pleased to have samurai back in their village. Each character is drawn and executed compellingly, though for my money Toshiro Mifune proves why he became one of Japan's most notorious film actors. His work as the brave, bold outcast of the seven is awe-inspiring practically all the way through, like the hero of a western that anyone can root for since he's a true rebel at heart within a group of men with a task at hand. 

Kurosawa directs his tale and main and supporting players like a grand composer, orchestrating a vivid story and extracting from great actors like Takashi Shimura (the old, wise Samurai), Ko Kimura (the disciple Samurai), Daisuke Kato (Schichiroji), and Mifune (Kikuchiyo, which isn't his real name) just the right touches of humanity, humor, tragedy, romance, and intensity. The overall intensity, by the way, isn't over-estimated; its long length (almost 3 1/2 hours) isn't distracting in the slightest since Kurosawa's editing and photography (the later helmed by Asakazu Nakai) are extraordinary. Not to compare the two films, but one thing I saw in common with Seven Samurai and a Lord of the Rings film is that, if anything else, it definitely isn't a boring experience. Along with a score by Fumio Hayasaka that gives the film just a bit more of a pulse, and a showdown that is relentless with excitement, this is one of the must-see action films for film buffs, or anyone with an serious interest in having fun with an epic.",3H27M

 Pather Panchali boasts of suitably melodramatic yet highly intuitive performances. Its breath taking cinematography ranks alongside existential beauty this side of Malick heaven. The musical scoring, by the great Ravi Shankar, is identifiably Indian, yet universally sublime. Together, these myriad parts melded into a whole so grand in its social consciousness, so incisively intimate in its portrait of one family, I could do nothing but be slowly devoured like a most willing prey. 

On 4th Oct 2003, I saw my all time favourite film, Tokyo Story. The feeling I got today from Pather Panchali, is as close as is possible from that fateful October day.

But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!"" 

The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business."" 

At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.

A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film.",2H13M

I read somewhere that the director took Charlie Chaplin as a model for his comedy, and the influence shows here, even to the point of the short-subject-length segments -- and especially in the first story. That one is basically a pure slapstick comedy, drawing gags from the situation of the Sharik character (who actually ends up resembling Harold Lloyd in appearance and behavior more than Chaplin) working part time on a construction site, alongside the man who he caused to be working there as a sentence. 

The second segment is the one I thought to be the greatest success, as it combines the visual humor (many sequences of which, throughout, would work without dialogue at all) with a well-tuned funny situation and good actor chemistry. The third and titular segment is amusing as well, but perhaps get a little too involved in its own story.

Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.

There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.

It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.

This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.

Along come two robots, ""Droids"" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.

The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.

With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you.",2H1M

A screen version of the works of the famous English writer Arthur Conan Doyle about the world's most famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his adventures with the notorious assistant Dr. Watson. Well, finally, I got my hands on this episode, shot by the talented Soviet director Igor Maslennikov. I love the whole series immensely and I revise it from time to time for the umpteenth time, and here's my short opinion - The Best Sherlock Holmes. I do not intend to talk about the minuses, because there are none, and if you really want to nitpick about the little things, then read the review of someone else. Yes, this is a very subjective review, but I will still describe the expressive merits that make this picture a real masterpiece of Soviet cinema. So, here they are: 1. Atmosphere - from the first shots, the creators immerse the viewer in Victorian England, or rather London, with its well-known attributes, stiffness, costumes, and norms of behavior. Environment, small details, scenery, nature. Yes, London was played by the Soviet Riga and Leningrad, but the audience doesn't care. The atmosphere is excellent in all parts. The creators clearly tried - and they have earned my praise and the love of the audience for more than one generation! 2. Music - the composer Vladimir Dashkevich has created amazingly high quality and so attractive music that it is known even outside the former Soviet Union. It's not worth mentioning the title topic, how many alterations I have heard, but nobody has succeeded in surpassing the original and will never succeed! 3. Humor - surprisingly, in such a serious detective story there was a place for humor. But there is no need to worry, it is easy to understand, but you should not wait for ""wild rzhaki"", rather humor here serves to defuse. 4. Detective stories - in the first episode (Acquaintance) our heroes are just getting to know each other and decide to solve one riddle, and in the second (Bloody Inscription) our homies have to unravel a rather curious and non-trivial case from the philistine point of view. Its finale will make you think about some things and seal the unbreakable friendship of a retired doctor and an eccentric London detective. Of course, when you are not watching a detective story for the first time, you lose interest, but you still enjoy the process itself, and when all this is played by very talented actors, it is doubly pleasure! 5. Excellent cast - the director has collected, I'm not afraid of this word, the entire color of Soviet cinema in this series, here are just a few names (in addition to the main characters): Igor Dmitriev, Borislav Brundukov, Nikolai Karachentsov and others. When so many talents gather under one roof, success is guaranteed! Well, the gatherings of Holmes and Watson at the end of each episode are priceless! Well, everyone knows about replacing the word ""Afghanistan"" with ""East"" in the first episode. You yourself know that it was in that year that we entered Afghanistan, and what this led to is known. Censorship, so I had to re-sound, nothing can be done. A little about the main characters: 1. Sherlock Holmes performed by Vasily Borisovich Livanov is an eccentric London detective who is able to solve any crime. Loves intricate puzzles. A monstrous snob with an unimaginable number of bad habits, but after meeting Dr. Watson, he becomes the last sincere and devoted friend. The best role of Vasily Borisovich in his entire long career and simply the best screen embodiment of the legendary detective! Sincere bravo Vasily Borisovich and good health to you! 2. Dr. Watson performed by Vitaly Methodievich Solomin is a retired military doctor who arrived after being wounded in London, where he rented an apartment for a couple with the mysterious Sherlock Holmes. The initial antipathy soon gave way to genuine admiration, and then to friendship between two so dissimilar characters. Cheerful, cheerful, with a brilliant military bearing. An inseparable assistant and a reliable support for Sherlock. Vitaly Methodievich just perfectly fit into this famous role, and we will never see the best Doctor Watson. Bravo Vitaly Methodievich and the Kingdom of Heaven to you! 3. Mrs. Hudson, performed by Rina Vasilyevna Zelena, is the owner of the house where Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson live. A kind and endearing elderly lady who becomes an invariable attribute that complements the image of Sherlock Holmes. Rina Vasilievna played this role in such a way that there can be no question of any competition. This is her best role and the best Mrs. Hudson! Bravo Rina Vasilievna! Soviet viewers were delighted with these two episodes, so soon new ones were released, where our heroes had to face the ""Napoleon"" of the underworld and no less dangerous bandits, but I will tell you about this another time. As a result, we have a great start to the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson with excellent detective stories, great music and atmosphere, and simply grandiose in their splendor acting works!",

Yes it does rank with them. The film makes the book seem almost hesitant, tentative; Doeblin's debt to Joyce all too obvious. But the film has an almost 'punk' bloody-mindedness about it, like a fanzine. Strong-flavoured sauce splashed over chips. And although 'epic' ( in the Brechtian sense, not the Cecil B de Mille) it has shape like a Mahler symphony has shape - not a simple arc but a scratty, jumbly progress through a crowd that gets you there ... As for central character Franz - played as Der Dumme Michel rather than the devious weasel of the book - he's the one to whom learning is so often offered but who is so incapable of embracing it. Fassbinder makes us care to try to understand the person whom we would move away from so rapidly in the Kneipe. This is simply one of the (many) cultural pinnacles of the 20th Century. Thanks to Channel 4 for introducing it to us 20-odd years ago and thanks to Second Sight who has published it on DVD. Buy it! Make time and enjoy it!",

Like the American Christmas tradition of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" it has become a staple on Latvia's TV screens around Jani, St. John's day, the Latvian celebration of the summer solstice. Written by Mara Svire it is director Janis Streic's best film. It is a film that can be watched on many levels. At the surface it is a broad comedy with universally recognizable characters and themes that are also uniquely Latvian. Aunt Mirta (Lilita Berzina) wins a car in a lottery and faster than you can say ""prieka"", relatives and acquaintances descend on poor Mirta's house like locust. There's her nephew (Uldis Dumpis) who, with wife and son in tow, gets off a tour bus in mid excursion and hitchhikes to Mirta's house for a visit the moment he hears of her windfall. There's her former daughter in law, with husband and daughter along, who pop in for a visit out of the blue. Even her next door neighbors, hard working and earnest farmers, are suddenly more helpful and attentive. None of this is lost on Mirta and she makes the most of it. It's a very Latvian film. There's a Latvian folk tale about a poor traveler who stops by a farmstead. Being hungry he asks the farmer's wife for some food and she promises him a meal in exchange for work. The labor is backbreaking, but he does it without complaint. When he finishes, the stingy farmer's wife tries to renegotiate. Pleading poverty she offers him some thin soup. He doesn't complain, but as he sips the watery brew he remarks that the soup is missing something. It needs something to go with the broth. The farmer's wife apologizes that she has nothing else to offer. All she has left is an old ax. The ax will be good he replies. The farmer's wife is incredulous, but he reassures her that in his travels he has often had ax soup and its one of the best meals he has ever had. You just have to know how to prepare it properly and it will be as tender and savory as the finest cut of meat. The farmer's wife seeing an opportunity to make something out of nothing drops the ax in the pot, but no matter how long they wait, the ax stays, well, as hard as an ax. The traveler suddenly remembers that the last time he had ax soup it also had some potatoes in it. Maybe that's what's wrong? The potatoes tenderized the ax. Unfortunately we have no potatoes. And just as suddenly the farmer's wife remembers that she might have some potatoes after all. Into the pot they go. The ax is still as hard. Maybe it was the carrots? There's carrots. Cabbage? Here's cabbage. On and on and into the pot they all go. Of course the ax never becomes any softer, but in the meantime the traveler has himself quite the meal. ""Limuzins"" is like that folk tale in reverse. It's the poor old farmer Mirta who exploits the greed of her guests. It doesn't take long before they are cutting her grass, building her a new cellar and doing all of her cooking and cleaning. All begging at the chance for being the one's to end up with the car. The film can also be viewed as one of those typical Soviet morality plays about bourgeoisie values being a corrupter of the human spirit. However, most importantly it's a film that took this very superficial party line and, between the lines, managed to pillory and parody that very same Soviet system. Where else but in the Soviet Union would an 80 year old woman who can't drive would end up with a car that she has no use for and doesn't really want, while everyone else has to scrape and then wait for years to end up with one? Even the title itself is a sarcastic reference to a car that was the Soviet equivalent of a Ford Pinto in a color that can be best described as off-white. ""Limuzins"" works on all of those levels. Like most of Streic's films its about characters and relationships. Its filled with humor and warmth and great performances, but it is it's ability to amuse while parodying a system that didn't tolerate being parodied that is perhaps its greatest achievement.",1H24M

His investigation leads to an...",1982-09-20,"sequel,second part,espionage,russian defector,assassination attempt",8.6,chaos-rampant,2012-12-26,"This is the sequel to the Tinker Tailor mini-series and last chapter in the Karla Trilogy (they skipped 'schoolboy'). Nothing has fundamentally changed: Smiley is brought out of retirement for one last round of spy games against Karla, his old nemesis. The 'old guard' which he visits (Connie, Esterhase) looks phased and weathered. The moral lines are blurry. The notion is that the world has changed, and doesn't really need these people any more. Smiley will be disowned by the Circus if discovered.

That's all fine. The series is from the great BBC tradition in narrative: the acting is uniformly excellent, it is a clean and riveting piece of fiction. Moreover, it is filmed in that BBC way I adore—transparent camera, natural light and textures.

Which brings me to a point I made in my Tinker Tailor post. I recommend this simply on its storytelling capacity to immerse you. And if you want a glimpse of how 1970's West Europe was like, it is indispensable viewing, absolutely so. 

But, it's also a spy film, and a spy film is to my mind one of the best templates for cinematic meditation.

Here's what I mean. You enter a world of some complexity that has machinery and movement, but enter long after the machinery has been set in motion. In the films, you (in the detective's shoes) are looking for this or that narrative device, here it turns out to be a girl, doesn't matter. 

In this film, the story really has started long before we enter, but you only learn this as you move through the first couple of episodes—in other words, midway through you suddenly have memories of this world. (one episode is capped by Smiley actually having a flashback)

So, because you have only a partial view of the story (reflected in the film in a crucial bit of evidence being a film strip), and the story shifts as you move through (indeed, you don't know there is a testimony that goes with the strip), this would be like a chess game where each new move shuffles the rules, trying to make sense is not enough. You will have to be still long enough for the thing to reveal itself. You have to spy.

Isn't this nice? You as a viewer will have to be able to see every corner while not being bogged down by detail. Indeed, whereas the bulk of intelligence operatives work as analysts, a good analyst is worth his weight in gold because he does just this: he can flow through a sea of information, salvaging only the crucial bits, the anchors that explain the story.

So, my notion of a good spy film is one that makes watching itself have agency in the world—any film would benefit from this, hence why a template. This is a step-up from Tinker Tailor, where after each episode we were summoned for a recap by the master sleuth, everything smoothed out for us. 

Oh, later episodes are forwarded by explanatory monologues and the story, as it turns out, is a personal bet so doesn't threaten an empire, but you have this structure and double identity of the girl at the center, which are fresh and powerful devices. And the sense of place is powerful —Paris, the Hamburg strip club and lake camp, quiet picturesque Bern, Berlin and the simmering anxiety of the Wall.

But the best piece of news is this: there is talk of a sequel to the recent Tinker Tailor film, which is going to be this one (alas for 'Schoolboy'). 

The film has what both of these don't, though they are otherwise excellent. It has abstraction in the film. It has not just the 'magicians' tricks, but magic that alters how we see. So, I'm hoping they go ahead with it, they will be building—as the first time—from a great primary text.",

I mean, could you imagine them slogging it out today, playing the state fair circuit, or worse, the street fair circuit? No, watch this film. See a band at its creative and energetic peak. Remember them as they were over the two or three days in which it was filmed. Of course, you must watch David Byrne. He would make his entire body a performance art. He would contort, jog, dance, leap, and even make his clothes a prop.

But, watch Tina Weymouth...

Tina is a very visual performer too. She says almost nothing, letting her bass guitar speak for her. And while David goes over the top often, Tina is subtle and sublime. With her body moves as she dances in place. With her facial expressions, her smiles, occasional raised eyebrows, and glances. Then when the action shifts to the Tom Tom Club (in order to give David a break and allow him to change into his big suit), her big moment is for one song only--""Genius of Love"" but man does she seize the moment and make it all her own! Rounding out the Talking Heads of course are drummer Chris Frantz (Tina Weymouth's husband for over 30 years now) and guitarist/keyboardist Jerry Harrison. When Chris takes the stage, he bounds up onto the riser, bows, and with a big smile, gets drumming. He is clearly enjoying himself during this and at the end of the show, he jubilantly throws his sticks into the audience. Jerry is a little harder to get a bead on. At times he's clearly enjoying himself, particularly on BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE. Other times he seems a little detached.

Rounding out the touring band are Alex Weir on lead guitar, Bernie Worrel on keyboards, Edna Holt and Lynn Marbry on back-up vocals, and Steve Scales on percussion. None are treated as sidemen, rather as an integral part of the show.

It has been commented that some ""sweetening"" of the sound was done. But I believe that it was to achieve sound consistency. I have heard several concert films with terrible audio (RUST NEVER SLEEPS comes to mind). Seeing this movie is what made me a Talking Heads fan back in 1985. Finding a copy at the used book store in 2006 is what helped me re-discover them.

It would be easy to dismiss the Talking Heads as all visual as all David Byrne. Such is not the case. The songwriting and musicianship was solid throughout the band's career. The band remained together for several more years, scoring several additional hits including AND SHE WAS, LADY DON'T MIND, & WILD WILD LIFE. They called it quits as a band in 1991, although all four members have remained active in music.",1H28M

It centers around the eldest son (Stimac) of a family led by a strict authoritarian father in Danilo Bata Stojkovic's magnificent incarnation. The young Petar struggles to graduate from high school mainly for one reason-he is so infatuated with his Marxism teacher that he cannot think of anything else but her during the classes. So when the graduation time comes, he lies to his father about passing in all the subjects while in reality flunking in Marxism.

Of course, the truth is not easy to hide and when it eventually comes out, his father is appalled and decides to punish him and lead his mind off from girls by finding a job for him in a local bakery. But that becomes complicated too when it turns out a beautiful and voluptuous girl is working there and she is an easy catch as well! Complications and comical twists just keep coming and coming here and the laughter never ceases. 

All this is going on during a very turbulent time, the '68 student revolution. My favorite scene is when Stojkovic throws out the TV because of the student uprising claiming it's immoral to watch it and then when Tito approves of the reforms he brings it back saying ""Comrade Tito has said that the students are right. We can watch television again!"" Paskaljevic was a master of socio comedy and all the actors do a great job. The ending is specially great and this is probably Slavko Stimac's best role.",1H31M

This brings together famous fairytale characters like Jack, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel and Cinderella into the mix to help.

This TV episode version I saw was a recorded stage play, but it was well acted out with neat special visual and sound effects, especially in the Giant's footsteps and the Witch's magic spells. It is captivating to see famous scenes from each fairytale blend in together throughout the main course of events of the baker and his wife searching for the Witch's items, such as the Baker's wife running into Cinderella into the woods, who happened to trip down some steps and looses her slipper, and the Witch (who is actually Rapunzel's mother) casting a spell on Rapunzel's prince. And, this all leads to a thrilling sequence when the character must deal with the Giant from the Jack and the Beanstalk tale.

This play also take a more dramatic and in depth look at each character, including the agony of the Princes finding love to the aftermath after Cinderella marries her prince. It's brilliantly played out and the plot gives a reality check that not all stories end in happily ever after - or at least not without some sacrifices and courage.

It's a great play for the audience, but not 100 percent innocent for children; therefore, it's best to have some parental guidance for the kids if or when they watch it.

`Silence of the Lambs' is  the story of a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) who is summoned to help find one serial killer called `Buffalo Bill.' by interviewing another.  Foster's performance is absolutely brilliant.  While Anthony Hopkins receives most of the (well-deserved) praise for his chilling portrayal of incarcerated serial killer `Hannibal the Cannibal' Lector', it is Foster's performance that holds the movie together.  The fear she shows just behind her eyes makes Clarice's outward courage all the more interesting and vulnerable.  This is the perfect way to play the part because it explains Lector's interest in Clarice.  Her only bargaining chip in getting Lector's help is to let him `feed' on her innermost secrets and fears in exchange for his brilliant insights into the psychotic mind.  The title of the movie comes from these exchanges and is very poignant.

Director Jonathan Demme is masterful.  There is one scene late in the movie that I will not spoil.  It is one of the most simply brilliant scenes ever staged in a movie.  I don't know if all the credit goes to Demme or the writers, but there is a moment in the film where the suspense builds beautifully to a what seems to be a common movie scene.  However, through skillful timing of the direction, the audiences assumptions are used against them and when the truth is revealed (hint: it involves a doorbell) it is shocking and induced a collective gasp from the audience I saw it with at the theatre.  It set the stage for an edge-of-your seat climax.

Do not miss this movie.

The movie is incredibly suspenseful and an absolute must see.",1H58M

The dialogue that's delivered in this movie is great and you need to understand Malayalam to really get the full effect - most times subtitles do not serve the local colloquialisms justice. If you like a good, old Malayalam comedy and have not seen this one you are definitely missing out.

The actors do a great job with Jagadish, Mukesh and N.N. Pillia commanding the leads. N.N. Pillai in his old age played the role of a disgruntled, senile patriarch of a gunda family perfectly. The events that unfold in the movie are great - the music is entertaining as well!

There was a time when georgian cinema was stalled, all new movies were at least forgetable if not worse (actually not that many movies were coming out at that time).Udzinarta Mze(english trsanslation would be

""Sun of Sleepless"" ) came out exactly at that time as a message that georgian cinematographic traditions weren't extinct. Movie is about Physician who is developing new treatment of cancer, but his studies are not well recieved because medical society is co ""closed"" one. He is not well recieved in the society in general because he is ""different"" and nobody needs him . Despite all this, his family is very supportive and his son who is seen in the begining of the movie as a some sort of criminal believes in his father more than anybody. As you might expect physician dies without achieving his dream.

Despite the fact that this movie is addressing the global problem of ""closed society"" it is very ""georgian"". Characters, relations between family, realtions between friends and outside world is very ""georgian"".

As you watch the movie you start liking the main characters more and more and you can feel that director has a huge compassion towards them, he really cares about them. Everything in this movie is outsdanding:story, cast, photography etc. Emotions can overwhelm you watching "" Sun of Sleepless"".

Movie is also full of comical and violent (latter is quite new to georgian cinema) episodes which are handled very tastefully and never go out of context, and you never get swayed away from the main theme, on the contrary these episodes are integral part of the movie. How does director do this? Don't know

Actors are magnificent. Guja Burduli playing the main character is extremly convincing as a struggling scientist, he is outstanding throughout the movie. D Kazishvili who plays his son Dato is not even a professional actor, but he does more than outstanding job, He steals the show in so many instances that him being amature is not even remembered.

And of course worth noting the haunting score written by director himself but one can see the roots coming out from georgian folk music.

Many things can be said about this movie, but there are not many movies out there that can deliver this level of perfect balance between realism and an art. It is an emotional filmmaking at its best.

It is simply a masterpiece of moviemaking!",2H3M

As with any masterwork, it is something one will have to pursue. For those that seek it out at the proper time, 'Baraka' can act as a milestone of revelation. What the viewer takes from this film will solely be determined by the life experience they bring to it. 'Baraka' is unique in that it actually requires a commitment of time and concentration. This is a film that communicates its message without utilizing standard film language. Those that try to make the images conform to the conventional notions of Hollywood story telling are likely to give up in frustration. For a film with no plot,characters or dialog, it communicates an astonishing number of profound themes. Those who are familiar with National Geographic or the works of David Attenbourough will have little trouble in identifying the fascinating locals and tribes, but be forewarned: there are reasons that there are no subtitles or text on screen. Personal discovery is at the heart of the filmmaker's intentions. The ambient soundtrack by Michael Sterns weaves the images together on a separate plain, producing a hypnotic pathway for the images to flow. Once you allow yourself to be pulled along by this current of sound the images will link themselves together and the true revelations hidden within 'Baraka' will make themselves apparent.

I checked a few anime trailers and I discovered Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal. At first I thought: 'Wow, is that Kenshin? He looks different. Wait, this looks a whole lot more serious than the TV series. I must watch this!' So I borrowed it from my friend and noticed how very well done it was. VERY well done. It gave nobody mercy regardless if they're bad or good. This isn't the type where everybody dies either, but the storyline is also twisted but it fits in at the end. It gets you thinking one thing, but the real story is about something else. I love it. I love it because it's a story about love. That's all it is! A really well done love story. In all, i think I've watched it more than six times and I still cry watching it. Don't get me wrong guys, this isn't a chick flick. It's action/romance/etc etc.. it can fall into a lot of genres. But in all, it's a great anime about love and life.

Even though I gave it a straight out 10, but I have to complain about one thing: characters... Most characters you didn't get a chance to know which you wish you did. But maybe they went into that during the last of it that continues after this. Who knows, anyway, good anime. Definitely recommended to people who aren't very fond of anime.",

It is indeed insightful for those who do not know the histories of these people, pretty much all of them terrific or outstanding, and it does try to take you inside their world. As one who has only really gotten into Jazz within the past few years, as just a history lesson it keeps attention most of the way through.

The problems one can find in the documentary could be really squared down to two. The first is that Burns, while talented and obviously with a good research team and plethora of pictorial aids, forgets something about Jazz- it's supposed to be fun! There's something about the sense of humor and vitality of jazz that gets lost among the heavy-handed narrations, that make jazz out to be as mighty and colossal as the Greeks or the Romans. Jazz is important to the world of music, but much of what is spoken trumps most of the experiences in the stories (not that a few of them aren't entertaining- most of the stuff involving Armstrong, Bix, Blaisie, and Art Tatum keeps interest that way). The second problem, which is a given considering the length of the documentary, is that there isn't enough room for everyone, and after Miles and Coltrane, it just halts. It would be intriguing if Burns went back and did a 'special edition' treatment, and cover more ground on what he had, and expand into the great jazz that did come out since the 60's (and there has been a few, believe you/me).

If you're wanting to get into the atmosphere, the moods and histories (and of course the music, some of it rare here) on Jazz, basically this is the best place to start. But if you're already an aficionado, or if you don't have the utmost attention span to watch all of the footage, it may comes to let-down.",

After her parents are turned into pigs, the young girl must infiltrate the bathhouse to find a way to make them human again.  Chihiro encounters an amazing array of strange and exotic creatures abiding there, some of whom help her in her quest and some of whom don't.

No one would ever deny the visual splendor and wealth of imagination that have gone into the look of this film.  The animators have created an entire world filled with inhabitants that defy description.  Moreover, the elegance of the backgrounds and the fluidity of the movement provide some of the best work in those areas that animation has ever offered.  One appreciates the effort, especially in this day and age when imagination in movies is at such a premium.  Therefore, I feel like a bit of an ingrate pointing out that `Spirited Away' might actually have been a somewhat better film had the filmmakers opted for a little LESS imagination in favor of a little more discipline in the storytelling.  The filmmakers are so busy trying to dazzle us with their creativity that we end up with more characters and subplots than the film can reasonably cope with.  The story often feels arbitrary in nature, with events that seem unrelated to each other vying for our attention just so we can be impressed with how creative everyone is trying to be.   The film seems to ramble for a good part of the time, and we find ourselves yearning for a tighter, more streamlined narrative to help keep us involved.  In addition, there's a certain lack of logic that runs through most of the film, making us question why certain characters do what they do. For instance, why would a bunch of spirits be so concerned with eating, sleeping, making money, riding trains, etc.?    The rules of this world don't seem to be laid down rigorously enough for us to understand what it's all supposed to be about.

I don't want to sound like a total curmudgeon in criticizing a film that, apparently, many people, including innumerable critics, have hailed as a masterpiece.  And I do concede that `Spirited Away' has moments of great beauty and charm to more than compensate for its rather slow pacing and excessive length.  A haunting trip on a ghostly train is, perhaps, the highlight of the film, a transcendent moment that hints at how great the rest of the film could have been had its makers not felt the need to pad out the story so consistently.  Chihiro is a spunky, poignant and noble heroine, and a few of the other characters are compelling as well. 

 `Spirited Away' offers much for the audience to gape and marvel at, but it lacks the drama to make us really care.",2H5M

Images speak of themselves in depicting the agony of the locals to preserve the little there's left of their historic site from modern man's ongoing exploitation.  This is a really low budget film with enormous results. The viewer is brought very near to the everyday life of the locals as they are left to speak and tell their own story.

After almost two decades of blood, sweat and tears (literally), the members of NC-17, and more heartbreaking, those close to the band (family, friends, wives etc) deal not with final, triumphant success, but, with the painful, sobering reality of failure. As a struggling writer myself, I completely identified with their journey. In pretty much all societies, (but, especially, America) no one is loved more than a winner, and there is nothing more leprous than a LOSER. However, the reality of life is for every winner, there are countless losers. For every successful rock band, there are tens of thousands that fail. For every successful spec screenplay sold, millions never see a dime - you get my drift. The most profound gift of Dov Kelemer's documentary is how it works like an 80 min therapy session. For anybody who is actually struggling to achieve something in life but facing the growing awareness that success is seemingly less and less likely - Won't Anybody Listen promises a real Catharsis. So little in society helps us cope with failure. Yet, so many fail everyday. The band, NC 17, may have failed, but, they have succeeded in showing that life goes on, we pull up our bootstraps, we soldier on. These people may not have got the record contracts, the limo rides, the millions. But, these 'losers' have something a lot of those 'successful' guys believe they have - integrity and strength.

The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.

The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children. 

The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.

The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all.

That is a rubbish description of this film of course but by it I mean that this is very hit and miss stuff. One moment I am roaring with laughter, only for the next for a whole section to fall flat (even though the audience are rolling and wiping tears from their eyes). Some of his stuff is very smart and very funny while other bits just seem lazy and a tad forced  with only the outrageousness of his material carrying him with the audience.

It is undeniable that race is a bit part of all his material and I can completely understand why some people dislike him for that. However for me his race-based material here (and there was a lot of it) is no different from the rest of his material in that it has hits and misses across it. This lack of consistency across the hour was a downer for me but the hits were just about often and strong enough to keep the show going. Chappelle himself runs the stage well and engages with his small audience like a pro. He is good at broaching whatever subject he sees fit to deal with, which is a good thing in a comedian rather than settling for comfort. At times this produces some material that is very funny as well as thought-provoking , sadly at other times I was left wondering what he was getting at (his attack on the kidnapped white girl was badly misjudged  surely the media that focused on this girl should have been his target?).

Overall though this was an enjoyable film even if it wasn't as consistent as I would have liked. Too hit and miss to appeal to a wider audience but for fans of Chappelle this will make for a good laugh.",

It features many of the former employees along with owner Paul Heyman and producer Ron Buffeon speaking on the promotion and what it stood for. They cover all of the things that made ECW famous such as the great story lines, the hardcore brutality, and the outstanding scientific wrestling, as well as Lucha Libre. As well as that, they shoot on the not-so-appreciated and controversial aspects of the promotion such as the defiant and counter-culture angles and incidents such as the infamous Mass Transit Incident and the storyline with Raven and Sandman.

It also talks about how it was before ECW was bought by Heyman and went ""extreme."" I learned a lot about the era when it was owned by Tod Gordon. I hadn't even previously known that ECW hadn't started off as being a hardcore promotion.

Another aspect of this documentary that I liked is how they take the time to split up the first section of it into taking time to talk about all of the company's most famous wrestlers, such as RVD, Raven, Sabu, Terry Funk, Sandman, Mick Foley and many others.

They talk about the Monday Night Wars and the Invasion angles as well, and I found it very interesting to hear the different sides of the story from WCW's Eric Bischoff, WWF's Vince McMahon, and ECW's Paul Heyman.

This is 320 minutes, but I would say the documentary itself minus the bonus matches lasts around 265 minutes. That may seem like a very long time, but I watched this in one sitting, and it was a 4 and a half hours that felt like 2.

This also had a great moral and a very conclusive ending, so it's well worth the time spent. Long live the original ECW!!!!!",

Even if you don't find it funny, you gotta admire their vocal range, the shape they're in and the amount of rehearsal that had to go into this. The jokes are silly, goofy(at times downright childish, though to be fair, they seem quite aware of this), creative, a tad meta here and there, based on pop culture(with accurate impersonations) and absurd(...not all at once). A couple of bits go on for too long, and/or are too repetitive... for example, they fake-argue with each other a lot, and in the first half hour, there are two or three humorous mentions of the imaginary props they're using. On the other hand, a few things are underused. With that said, they get a ton out of rather little in the way of visible means. They go to ""other places"", and ""meet"" famous, iconic characters. The fast pace that this mostly maintains keeps it from overstaying its welcome. Hardly anything falls flat, and at their best, the 2 are hysterical, and clearly immensely talented. There is occasional ""violence"", disturbing content, sexuality(a bunch of it will go over kids' heads) and moderate language in this. The DVD is a real treat; the ""Brothers"" recorded many menus, and it holds an actors commentary track(which is hilarious, has several facts, and references the running gags in the show) and other laugh-garnering features, such as outtakes, MTV stuff, an Unnecessary Music Video, etc... it totals at about 43 minutes(though the cover claims it's 61).

We follow it from the very beginning in 1940 until its liberation by Russian troops in January 1945. We also get a glimpse of the aftermath in the form of the Nuremberg trials and we follow the destiny of central figures in the extermination of Jews, Gypsys, Russian POWs and political prisoners from mainly Poland. One of the most unpleasant aspects of this story is that some of the survivors of the camps has lead a miserable life after the war as they were not welcomed by various reasons when they returned home. 

The series contains 6 episodes of about 45 minutes each. It is build up by interviews of former prisoners as well as a couple of guards. There is also extensive footage in the form of photography, film-clips and various documents.

In an attempt to make the story come more alive the producers have also hired German actors to play out the role of central figures in Auschwitz; Rudolf Höss, Adolf Eichman, Heinrich Himmler and Dr. Joseph Mengele to name a few. With the help of computer techniques the buildings of Auschwitz has been rebuild in order to get a view of how the camp looked like with specific attention to the gas-chambers and the barracks were the prisoners lived.

So a lot of work has been put into telling the story of one of the darkest chapters in human history. It is truly a depressing tale that leaves you with the big (and unanswered) question: how could this happen? And how can we avoid this happening again? For some reason BBC has chosen not to interview other than eye witnesses and therefore I personally was missing the explanation that a historian, sociologist etc could give to the phenomenon of Holocaust. As a psychologist myself I wondered about this; how can the combination of hatred and discipline be stronger than empathy with the prisoners? Empathy is not something that we choose but something that is always there. So how could those that were involved with the slaughtering of the prisoners not empathize with them? Maybe they did empathize with them after all - but empathy does not always lead to sympathy. It can also lead to sadism I think. Either way, the ability to empathize would dictate that the Germans were not unaffected by their actions which we also are told. Höss never liked the killings and especially in the beginning when it was done by shooting it made him uneasy.

One of the more controversial stories that are being told is that the allied forces refused to bomb the railroad-tracks leading to Auschwitz although they knew what was going on and although they were bombing IG Farben only 6 kilometers away. We have an eyewitness from Auschwitz telling us, that she saw the airplanes from the allied forces flying by and from an air photo of the camp we see that it is easy to identify the crematorium. Why didn't the allied forces drop a few bombs? This is really beyond me and makes me wonder if the allied had some sort of hidden agenda.

Another more controversial story is the story of the Hungarian Jews. The Germans apparently tried to bargain with their lives and wanted trucks in exchange of Jews. In a document from the allied forces we learn that it was seen as ""blackmail"" and that the allied forces saw a big problem in getting around 700.000 (I think) Jews to house and to feed. So the consequence was that they went straight to Auschwitz and the gas chambers.

Especially one interview with a guard by the name of Oskar Gröning is remembered; he is without remorse but decided to participate when he learned that theHolocaust by some people are being denied. The lack of remorse is interesting. It is tempting to understand the absence of this as a result of defense mechanisms at work. 

I will not give this top rating as there was too much description and too little explanation. I also think that it was unnecessary to employ actors. A good narrative could have done the work instead. On the other hand you have the invaluable interviews with the eyewitnesses who will be dead and gone in a few years.

I was very disappointed with The Clay Bird.

I found that the story chopped and changed from one character to another all to frequently, failing to stay long enough on one part of the story for you to really care what was happening.

Yes, some of it was beautifully shot, but I have said this before with other films, is it possible to not to have glorious scenery in a place as geographically beautiful as Bangladesh?

I would rather the story concentrated on 2 or perhaps 3 of the characters, giving a far more detailed account of life in this traumatic part of Bangladesh's history.""""""""

To Meejoir from Newcastle, England, Don't think this story from the perspective of your culture. You said""Too many characters and too little story."" but it based on a great history of Bangladesh and the different mentality of our people..

In a perfect world, or even a decent one, Louis CK would be as big as Chris Rock. Unfortunately, a little unfunny frat-boy by the name of Dane Cook stole some of his best material, and legion of drunken college students who worship Cook helped make him the celebrity he is today. If I were Louis CK, I'd be taking legal action, but Louis is smart enough to let it go, and continue coming up with new, funnier material. That better material is prominently featured in 'Shameless', one of the few stand-up specials that have truly left me crying from how much I laughed. Like George Carlin, Louis CK has the ability to show that anything, no matter how mean-spirited or dark, has the capacity to be funny, if not hilarious. He also has the type of brutal honesty that the popular comedians of today lack. He's not afraid to talk about any aspect of his personal life. His humor is frank, original, and daring. 'Shameless' is a must-see for anyone with an interest in comedy. 10/10",

Regardless of what your opinion is on current day socio/economic/political society. This documentary is of such outstanding cinematographic quality, that it just cannot be ignored. It looks like they went through all the pieces of film of the last 4 decades to make this! And the use of sound is simply astonishing.

I usually loathe the 'leading' documentary, like Michael Moores cheap propaganda I just refuse to watch out of principle. However, 'What Happened to Our Dream of Freedom' is very direct and conscious about it guiding the viewer. To redeem itself it simply contains so much facts and correct historical reference, it doesn't become a 'mockumentary'.

If you do not agree with the vision that we are all trapped in a system of numbers and targets, just see this film document as you would a riefenstahl. Commend it on it's graphical excellence supported with great sounds, a vicious style and sublime directing. See it anyway if you like (political) documentaries.

Bobby is his name, I believe. Anyway, it takes place at his apartment where everyone is waiting for him to show up for his surprise birthday. And then it goes back and forth in his conversations with these friends and with some of his former dates. Since it's Sondheim, you definitely don't expect anything conventional to be going on. In fact, this version is even more unusual since the entire cast are also playing instruments while enacting their parts. Most of the women are fine here especially the ones playing Marta and Joanne. And I was impressed throughout with Raul Esparza as the leading character especially when he sang ""Being Alive"". Nice humorous touches throughout and still a timely observation of what it's like trying to connect with love in the big city. For that reason, not to mention Sondheim himself discussing his contributions in a separate segment afterward, I highly recommend this version of ""Company"".",

I love Louis' delivery and he really knows how to keep a crowd going. He isn't afraid to talk for a long time without any laughs, just to set up a joke. On a comedy level this is a hilarious show, but what I am missing is a hidden meaning, a message, something that connects his stories and makes them a complete show.

I have seen this movie twice now and I really wanted to like it. I love the Planet Earth-Series and other nature/environment-related movies, but this one is a little...special. First of all, the visuals (e.g. photography) are stunning and very beautiful. Sadly, this is the only real good thing about this movie. What I consider bad about this movie? Well, there are several things:

The whole movie has a kind of instructive touch (as in preaching from above to dumb people) and it seems as if the filmmakers thought of their audience as stupid and therefore repeat everything over and over again - maybe they have to, but it still leaves a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. | The narration: Firstly, the (female) narrator is not bad, but in no way can she compare to David Attenborough of the Planet Earth-Series. The narration makes this movie seem a little alarmist, but not in a way that shocks you and makes you want to change things, but in a way that makes you think 'Yes, yes, I know! You said that already!'. Then, there is the vocabulary used. This is one of the things that disturbed me from the start (especially me as a German). Talking about herding cattle as keeping livestock ""in concentration camp-like conditions"" is not only outrageously insensitive, but also outright stupid. While saying things like this may be effective in creating attention, there are definitely better ways to do so. And why is half of what the narrator is saying numbers and statistics without any reference or comparison? Nobody will remember any of the numbers anyways, so please, at least give us the numbers with a context! | I personally don't like what I call the ""spiritualistic approach"" of this movie. By this I mean, that it is repeated over and over how everything in this world is connected and how humans are kind of a tumor on this earth that ruins it. While this may be true to some degree it still leaves a weird taste and makes this movie seem like creationist propaganda (which I am sure it is not, I'm just saying that this is not a very smart thing to do). | The movie basically only complains about the destruction of the earth by humans but offers no real solutions. The solutions it offers are ones that are already being used (e.g. using solar power) or are weirdly esoteric ones (e.g. everybody live in peace, the rest will work itself out). - This movie is very over-simplistic and one-sided. While none of the things being said are really wrong, most of them aren't really correct either. By using (debatable) arguments like this, the movie gets a bit of a manipulative touch. | While sponsoring this movie might be a good idea for the companies involved, this leaves one question: Why was every company allowed to put their name on this movie? Most of the companies produce in so-called third-world countries under worst circumstances for the workers and sell the products as luxury articles in industrialized countries and therefore actively take part in some of the activities that this movie wants to tell you about - so why the heck did the filmmakers take their money? | All in all, as a movie, this film isn't very entertaining. There is not really anything more than the visuals to keep you watching it, the narration is basically mostly throwing statistics at you and there is simply nothing new to it. | Another big problem with this movie is, that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It isn't a documentary, but it isn't a normal picture either. It starts with stating that certain things are bad about the way humans treat the earth, but keeps adding stuff until you just don't care anymore. For example, the narrator says, that eating meat is bad for the environment. Then it adds, that coal mining is bad, goes on to say something else is bad and so on. Starting from 'Oh, yes, that's interesting, I didn't know that!' you will go to 'Okay, so everything is bad?' This IMHO also weakens the message of the movie a lot, the filmmakers should have just focused on fewer issues to tackle instead of being against environmental destruction, industrialism, globalization and the military. Don't get me wrong, it is very right to be against all of those things, but being against all of them at once is just hard to communicate in only one movie.

Also, please keep in mind that this movie is NOT a documentary in the usual sense of the word. There is nothing that is being documented, there is nothing new and there is nothing innovative in any way about this movie. While this is not necessarily bad, it changes the focus of the film from being a very boring documentary (which, as I have already said, it is not) to what it really is, a beautiful, but still only mildly entertaining movie.

So, in short: If you haven't seen the Planet Earth-Series, go see it now! If you have already seen it and watched all the other recent documentaries about environmental issues and want to see this one, go on and see it, but don't expect it to be more than average. Keep in mind what I have written above about this movie not being a documentary and you should be happy with it. About my rating: Considering 10 is the best and 1 is the worst possible rating on IMDb, I gave this movie 6 stars. 5 stars is average, I added two stars for the awesome visuals, none for the narration (above average voice-work, but without any real substance) and subtracted one point for things that really made me angry (for stuff like the concentration camp-reference and similar things).",1H58M

The lowlight for me was seeing former studio head Bob Shaye, a man broken after losing control of his studio due to politics.

Season five was easily the weakest season of the resurrected show and gave the impression that the audience were watching cast off scripts from the previous regime of RTD even down to the Tennantesque dialogue of the eleventh Doctor so I expected to see some seasonal fluff with the oxymoronic sub heading of "" Christmas special "" 

Premonitions were confirmed in the opening hook where Amy and Rory are aboard an intergalactic cruse liner which instantly reminded me of the STAR TREK movies . Not only does Moffat rip off RTD but he also has to seek inspiration from ST . Things weren't looking good for Amy , Rory and thgis viewer 

Despite this I became more and more involved as the story continued. It's a sophisticated reworking of A Christmas Carol featuring unrequited love and redemption . What works so well apart from the stunning performances of Gambon and Jenkins is the lightness of touch in Moffat's writing . It's manipulative to a certain degree but we never get the teeth gnashing and tear stained scenes that caused overkill in the RTD finales 

If there's a slight flaw to the story it borders on being a fantastical fairytale rather than straightforward science fantasy that the show was famous for since its inception in 1963 . But Moffat has described that he thinks of the show as being a dark fairy tale and if he takes the show in this direction he'll certainly get no complaints from me . Especially since Matt Smith seems to improve in every episode he's in

As a footnote however I notice this special has only received an average rating of 6.8 which is on a par with Victory Of The Daleks ! I do hope fans aren't expecting to see old monsters appear adnausuem in season 6",

Then here's It's Such a Beautiful Day, a movie that I maybe laughed once in. It's quite the progression, but it serves to show us where Hertzfeldt wants to go next.

I Am So Proud of You will always be my favorite of these films. It's a perfect balance of black comedy and utter sadness. It's probably one of my favorite movies ever. It's Such a Beautiful Day scarcely seems like a continuation of that plot thread, though. While it still rends at the heart like any good tear-jerker, it's just separate from this trilogy in terms of style. And that's why I really like this movie; it cements itself as standalone from the already present chronology, but it still gives Bill a proper ending(?) with philosophy and physics worked into the musings of an average everyday stick figure.

Entertaining documentary taking a look at the entire ROCKY franchise and how Sylvester Stallone was pretty much broke, desperate and on his last shot when he wrote the screenplay for the first, which would end up a massive hit and get ten Oscar-nominations. Stallone, Burt Young, Carl Weathers, Lloyd Kaufman, Robert Chartoff, Irwin Winkler, Dolph Lundgren and Frank Stallone are just a few of the faces who show up to share their memories on the making of the series. If you're a die-hard ROCKY fans then it's a very safe bet that you've heard most of the stories here but if you're new to the series and wanting a quick guide behind their popularity then this is a great place to start. I'm sure fans who are already familiar with the story are still going to have fun going down memory lane as the cast give some behind-the-scenes stories. We get to hear how the studio didn't want Stallone to direct part 2, we hear how ROCKY III got off on a bad start and how Stallone ended up in the hospital after being punch by Lundgren in part four. The most interesting segment comes with part five as Stallone really opens up on what he was trying to do with the film and everyone talks about why they felt it bombed so badly with critics and fans. There's even talk of the original ending that almost made the picture. Also interesting is hearing how every studio turned down the sixth film in the series and Stallone talks about having to pretty much start from scratch just like he did with the first movie. Overall this is a very entertaining documentary full of great stories and it's always fun catching up with the cast members.",2H

Some huge political scandals were missed from most commonly known (and taught) history, I don't know if I agree with all of the opinions, but the facts, the evidence, that speaks for itself! A huge amount of it is quoted, referenced and some from actual recordings from the politicians at the time. And for the sceptics, Yes it does check out, although some is hard to find.

After watching this, I've decided to store the recordings to use to help teach my son the real story of what built the world he's entered into. And to give you some perspective of how ground breaking this program is, my son is currently 3 months old! And it will be saved for prosperity until he's old enough to comfortably assimilate such information.

That's how important and rare this type of clarity and open minded viewpoint is. Every human being on the planet should turn off X factor and watch this, If they did the human race would stand a much better chance. 

Oliver, if you ever read this, I hope to meet you one day and shake your hand! Many Thanks.",

Of course, like most other liberals, he is very good at pointing out the problems of civilization through the ages, but not very helpful when it comes to solutions to prevent war, starvation, genocide, homelessness, religious persecution, and other injustices of recent history. I am kind of reminded of the Assistant Principal in South Park when I see displays like this. ""Drugs are bad, OK?, War is bad, OK"", Genocide is bad, Ok?, Starvation is bad, OK?. Yes, Mr. Waters, we know. What separates Mr. Waters and Pink Floyd from the rest of the bleeding hearts is his ability to tap into the isolation and dismay of millions of people in the world who feel there is no hope, no chance for human salvation, no chance for human beings to overcome their despicable shortcomings, and no chance to break through that psychological wall of bureaucracy, indifference, callousness, and authoritarianism. Yes, all these things are bad, too, OK? But the real questions beg to be asked: What should we do about it? How should we live our lives, work, raise families, and age in such a world?

Lin-Manuel Miranda... *Insert Clapping and Standing Ovation*. He was seemingly crafted this show and he has done a tremendous job

The writing of the songs is fantastic and they are soooo catchy

Set design was brilliant and seeing this stage production through a camera was really enticing and left me wanting more

Funny in parts, sad in others. I felt 'Hamilton' had a great balance

Performances by everyone was fantastic... words don't do it justice

Lafayette - Hilarious

Cons

Not many... But I did become a little confused with some plot points, that may have just been me though

Overall, I thought 'Hamilton' was an absolute blast. The songs, performances were truly amazing and I will be listening to the soundtrack for a while now! Hats off to Lin-Manuel Miranda because he has crafted this from the ground and wrote the lyrics to the songs and the script. Honestly it is a fantastic achievement for him. I've never been a massive fan of musical theatre but 'Hamilton' has proved to me that there are some gems out there. I hope Disney or other companies release future productions on streaming sites because I can guarantee 'Hamilton' will be a wide success.

Old films have become journeys to the past; ways to visit times and people that no longer are.  Since film is an art that is based on the innovation of previous works, it has an element of nostalgia in its foundation.  We look on the old to find what elements should make up the new.  In City Lights, and other silent works of film, a passion emerges that is uniquely honest and sincere.  While watching the film, I was impressed that Chaplin really did love the story, the sets, the crew; the whole project.  While this may not have been the complete reality, it felt that way, and thus made the film more enjoyable.  In silent films the audience is forced to be completely reliable on the visual elements of the film; there are no elaborate sound effects or dialogue to provoke an emotional response.

Since film is at its very core a visual medium, I find silent films to be the basic form of the medium.  I don't use the word basic here in a demeaning sense, but I compare the beauty of silent films to the beauty of early European art, before the concept of perspective was developed in the Renaissance.  Many books and tomes featured people as tall as the castles they stood in; these works of art were not technologically advanced, but they were, and are, beautiful.  The same example is found when comparing early darreographs of wild animals to contemporary photographs found in National Geographic. There is a warmth found in City Lights, and other Chaplin films (The Kid, Modern Times) that would be lost in the sea of cinematic technology that floods films today.  Maybe it's just that with simplicity comes honesty, and honesty is perhaps the most powerful emotion that can cross through the screen and be felt by the viewer.",1H27M

Chaplin, probably the best film-maker/performer of the 20th Century, did not despair though. He fought back with heart and emotion and by 1936 ""Modern Times"" was a major box office and critical success. It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change. As a factory worker in the film, Chaplin tries to cope with the industrial revolution and tries to make it through a quickly changing U.S. economy. He finds love with vagrant Paulette Goddard (who ended up marrying Chaplin in real life) and the two come together and lean on one another in a world of uncertainty and change. ""Modern Times"" is one of those films that will put a smile on your face, but it could make you weep just as easily. Chaplin's world was changing (and not necessarily for the better from his point of view) and he wanted to express the variations in his old way of doing things and the new way everyone else had accepted. Goddard is also probably the best actress to match Chaplin's charm in one of his pictures. Their love for one another (even though the marriage lasted a relatively short amount of time in real life) just seems to shine on the silver screen and they have a chemistry that is sweet and heart-warming. Beautifully made, wonderfully written, perfectly performed, smart, insightful and always brilliant, ""Modern Times"" is another film from Chaplin that will brand itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",1H27M

Well this movie is certainly a lot better than any of the more recent ""Bollywood"" musicals I've seen, and it's probably even one of the best musicals I've ever seen from anywhere. What really stands out in Pyaasa in particular is how the music is often used to express serious themes and social critiques, which is something I've rarely ever seen in a musical. The ending was also quite unexpected and very moving. The last few scenes and dialogues in particular were powerful and had a lot of meaning to them.

The star of the show here is Guru Dutt, who was not only the director and producer, but also starred in the film as the protagonist Vijay (a struggling poet from the slums), comparable to the versatility of Orson Welles in Citizen Kane. The two main actresses in the film, Mala Sinha as the married ex-girlfriend Meena and especially Waheeda Rehman as the prostitute Gulabo, were also impressive. In some ways, the story has some similarities to that of Moulin Rouge! (2001) but even better than that in my opinion. The music by S. D. Burman and his son R. D. Burman also has a timeless feel to it. I would highly recommend this movie to musical fans, or even if one is not a musical fan, I still think it's worth checking out.

While Pather Panchali and Aparajito, the trilogy's first two, are extremely well crafted, the lack the heart-wrenching beauty of this installment. These three films revolve around tragedy, and it has an almost predestined quality to it, which reminded me somewhat of Stanley Kubrick's excellent, ""Barry Lyndon."" That's where the similarities end of course, as this film is warm and radiates humanity, and Lyndon (as well as all of Kubrick's work) is cold and icy. Ray's rich lyrical realism breathes beauty in the mundane acts of his characters. The film opens as Apu, now a young man, attempts to eek out a living. He searches relentlessly for work, most of which is monotonous and doesn't pay well. However his pudgy friend Pulu invites him to a wedding, and Apu obliges, hoping maybe this display of love will help inspire him and the novel he is writing. In a fascinating turn of events (which I won't spoil,) Apu finds himself coming back to Calcutta married. Aparna, his new bride, is used to a life of luxury outside of the big city` but she is prepared for a life of poverty with her new husband. In one of the most beautiful sequences in film, Apu and his bride slowly begin to love and care for one another. The beauty of this is that we never see them embrace, or kiss or make love. Instead we see it in gestures, in window curtains, in little notes Aparna puts in Apu's cigarettes reminding him only to have one after every meal. Their love is like a dream of love we've had, one that's so innocent and wonderful we want to dream forever. But like all dreams, Apu must wake up. Happiness is just a fleeting emotion for Apu, one that enters his life at random points and then dissapears. Apu wanders bitterly through the Indian landscape, searching for solace and peace. The end moments cannot be explained in words, and simply must be experienced. One of the greatest films of all time. 10/10",1H45M

Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling.  He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).

Forget the recent remake and after about ten minutes you'll certainly forget that this is thirty-odd years old and made in black and white. Maybe its high-class soap opera but even so its all class.

Truly a saga spanning four or five generations, the story is dominated by Eric Porter's Soames, the cold venal rapist who eventually commands our grudging respect and the truly beautiful Irene played by Nyree Dawn Porter, Soames' victim who later finds love. And then there's Susan Hampshire's pretty but totally selfish Fleur, drawing you eye whenever she's on-screen. Incidentally, Nicholas Pennell plays Fleur's husband as if he was Wilfred Hyde-White in My Fair Lady! There are many other major characters, all well portrayed and you'll really care what happens to them.

Even the make-up of the two Porters is worth a word of praise as they age convincingly.

A minor criticism I could make is the rather eccentric recording of the sound. The dialogue level soars and drops as if the microphones were concealed in flowerpots like the early talkies. Doors slam loudly and there are unidentified knocks and bangs in the background.

See this masterpiece of television if you can, I don't think it has been bettered.",

Their faces have anticipation written all over them, even while the most interesting things they can find to do are toying with a fly, drinking water from a hat and cracking their fingers. A dog runs past. The windmill squeaks. The ticket vendor is locked away. The heath bounces off the wooden platform. The men sweat. Are you bored yet? Then this movie is probably not for you. But are you dying to know what the three men are waiting for? Does a light anxiety creep onto you whilst reading that description? Can't you wait for the tension to resolve? Then this movie is all you ever wanted.

The almost lawless world where outlaws and bandits roam the country with ease that is the setting of the story, is shown by Tonino Delli Colli (director of photography) in all its splendorous grandeur and it's uncountable little details. The set pieces, the costumes and the real life locations in Arizona and Utah make everything believable. And together with the characters and figurants, everything creates a vibrant and utterly believable Western civilisation.

Charles Bronson plays the man with the harmonica: a lone wolf looking for something that he chooses not to reveal to anyone until he gets it. A character with no name roaming the endless fields under the sun, announcing his presence at all times with the same melody he plays on his harmonica that echo's in an unsettling way. Bronson does this brilliantly, with a face that overflows with held back emotions and a determination that is downright scary.

In a tavern the man meets Manuel 'Cheyenne' Gutiérrez (Jason Robards), a bandit that recently escaped being hung by the neck, re-joining his band of outlaws. With already greying hair, he takes on the situation that arises in the area, trying his part to be the hero that saves the day. Robards portrays a character that, by only one look at him, we can see how the years have shaped him. His performance is outstanding; we want to grab a drink with Cheyenne, but we also get the feeling that being on your guard around him wouldn't be an overrated luxury.

The 'damsel in distress' (although she isn't in the original meaning of the word) Jill McBain (played by Claudia Cardinale) turns into a toy of Fate itself. Without any warning she gets involved in something quite over her head, but she handles it masterfully; she refuses to return to New Orleans with her tail between her legs and stays to face the difficulties put before her. Cardinale playing Jill is both an erotic marvel and a woman you wouldn't want to cross.

They are all opposed by Frank (Henry Fonda): the local gang leader with a heart of stone and a business proposal at the ready at all times. With his ruthless blue eyes and his gun at the ready he keeps the town quiet. Fonda gives you the creeps with just one gaze at the camera and every sentence leaves the bitter taste of malfeasance.

And finally, Gabriele Ferzetti finishes the line of main characters with his deliciously sickening portrayal of the crippled railroad baron Morton. A character that you'd like to slap in the face, but one you feel pity for as well. Outstandingly brought!

The soundtrack is composed by the never beaten maestro of film scoring himself: Ennio Morricone. His genius lies in the creation of themes and melodies that will haunt your dreams forever for better or worse. The melancholic main theme that is brought with a heavenly choir draws tears from your eyes after hearing only a couple of chords. The theme of the man with the harmonica is as unsettling as it is epic and Cheyennes' theme creates the lighter counter points in the movie. Morricone uses these motifs ingeniously, hinting at plot points, character motifs and feelings and giving you a sense of the world the movie takes place in. If I could give twelve out of ten stars for the score, I'd do it.

Sergio Leone was a masterful director, no need to prove that. He manages to turn even a scene of seven minutes, where three men are merely waiting for a train, into an epic storyline. Two hours and three quarters the tension builds and then resolves... partially, always building towards the end. And that finale! That finale! That finale chilled me to the bone! Throughout the film, question after question is raised, and when one question is answered, another one pops up. So when all pieces of the puzzle fall into place to the score of Ennio Morricone, how can one not be moved by it?

For Leone, there was no better way to reach the top of the Western genre. And for us, there never will be a film that is more Western than 'Once Upon a Time in the West'.",2H45M

Often detail is eliminated for sake of time and the plot loses aspects that are key to the real story.

The team of John Le Carre and John Irvin has created what may go down as the benchmark for the Spy story mini series. In six hours of television they lay out piece by piece the background of each of the characters in a slow and gentle manner enabling the viewer to capture a sense of both the person and the time in which they are placed.

Irvin permits the story to move in a 'typical English manner', with George Smiley, the principal character almost rolling along from one event to another. Alec Guinness is outstanding in this role and it seems the it was either written with him in mind or he was born for it. I suspect the later is more likely. Smiley and his quirks are key to unravelling what is a complex plot with the usual twists and turns of they spy genre.

The casting of the rest of the players is equally superb with an ensemble performance by the who's who of the English stage. The goodies are all flawed people while the badies, many of who are within the British Secret Intelligence Service, are bad in the way that only the English can truly be to each other.

Their reputation is more than borne out. ""Deadly Fight"" picks up where its predecessor in a three-part arc left off, and uses Conan Doyle's story ""The Final Problem"" as a basis for embellishment and the creation of a wonderful film. It's a great attitude to take towards the original stories, and here ""The Final Problem"" is blended masterfully with elements from ""Charles Augustus Milverton"" in the previous film. One wouldn't have expected the one of the best film versions of this completely English character, and one that should feel so very right, should have been filmed in Russian.

Livanov's Holmes is one of the best I have seen: calm and friendly but totally in-command and both suited to an intellectual display through dialogue and quietly prepared for springing into action. He can change the tenor of a scene with ever-so-minor variations in his performance. Vitali Solomin is just about perfect as Watson. He rally becomes a full character here with the help of some great touches in the script -- and seemingly effortlessly as everything is still drawn from the spring of what we know from Conan Doyle. Viktor Yefgrafov is a slithering, creepy, and truly unnerving Professor Moriarty here in a great piece of casting.

The direction and pacing keep this film totally suspenseful and macabre all the way through. The viewer can really feel the sense of claustrophobia and impending doom as Moriarty makes his presence subtly known everywhere Holmes goes, leading up to a brilliant scene before the Reichenbach Falls as Holmes contemplates his destiny. It all balanced with just enough humor (such as in the scene where Watson unexpectedly runs into Lestrade) to keep it from being too oppressive. The ending is legitimately affecting no matter how well one knows that Holmes survives. In all, it's almost flawless, and looks gorgeous as well, with plenty of impressive location footage. If you couldn't tell, I recommend it and will be watching more.",

His acting is superb, as demonstrated by the fact that ""The Hunt for the Tiger"" is a Sherlock Holmes film that doesn't suffer by the fact that Sherlock Holmes doesn't appear for over half of its length.

Watson here is very believably an, intelligent, loyal man with the deep feelings of a creative writer and the drive to help others of a good doctor. This allows this excellent adaptation of Arthur Conan Doyle's ""Adventure of the Empty House"" (skillfully folded into a three-part serial with ""Charles Augustus Milverton"" and ""The Final Problem"") becomes not just a tense and suspenseful mystery and adventure story, but also a very human drama about Watson and Mrs. Hudson's loss of Holmes, and later, of course, their joy when he returns. When he does come back Vasili Livanov is excellent as always; I'm not sure I could imagine any other actor pulling of the unlikely scene of Sherlock Holmes crying as well.

The direction and pacing are as finely-tuned as ever, and everything seems to hit the right note, with the events of the previous two films being wrapped up nicely. Once again I applaud the filmmakers who could make Sherlock Holmes speak Russian, and be more believable than on most occasions when he speaks his original English.",

This movie isn't your regular Animated Film. Pixar and Disney put films out there with happy endings. I'm not saying there bad films at all. They are also great pieces of work. But Grave of the Fireflies tells you the truth. This movie isn't trying to entertain you. It wants to inform you about how war is really like. There were many moments in the movie, that just brought me to tears.

I am kind of upset, that this movie didn't get many awards as it should. In that regards, it is VERY underrated and it is kind of thrown apart. When it should really be respected and praise it. If this movie was made in our time period right now. I would be 100% sure this would of Won an Oscar for Best Animated Film. This is Studio Ghilbi's best movie they have ever released.

I truly advice you to bring a handkerchief, cause chances are that you will cry.

An Emotional Epic Animated Film, that I recommend everyone to watch.

Three unemployed men struggle to earn a living and decide to get involved in a kidnapping scheme to make quick money.",N/A,"kidnapping,lie,rescue,drunkenness,deception",8.5,Lucabrasisleeps,2009-01-29,"I first saw this movie around 15 years ago when I was a little kid. Even though I have seen the movie around a hundred times, I still don't get bored. The reason are the memorable characters and the clever comedic lines that are unforgettable. This movie may not be generally mentioned as one of the greats when discussing Malayalam cinema but among common Malayalees this movie would stay in their hearts for years to come.

The plot is quite unique. Balakrishnan(Saikumar) and Gopalakrishnan(Mukesh) are two unemployed youth who somehow get a place to stay in the city due to Mannar Mathai's(Innocent) kindness. They fight with each other all the time and life continues till one day they get a phone call(a wrong number) from a gang who have kidnapped a girl. They then hatch a plan to deceive the thieves and get the money for themselves. How they achieve this forms the rest of the story. The screenplay is just perfect. Each scene is perfectly constructed so as to lead to the next scene and it doesn't feel like a few scenes are added unnecessarily just for comedy. In the first half, the scene when Balakrishnan comes to ask Mannar mathai for a room is just absolutely hilarious! It is one of the scenes which can stay in your mind for a lifetime. Innocent's subtle comedy is one of the best aspects of this film. His sarcasm and his manner of speaking are the highlights of this movie. The second half of the movie is pretty exciting. There is so much confusion in the second half that you would marvel at how the writers somehow tie up all the loose ends. The character of Hamsakoya is also really funny and in the second half also, he becomes useful in a totally different way. The emotional scenes are also not misplaced and jell perfectly with the movie. One of my favourite scenes is when Balakrishnan asks Gopalakrishnan whether he told the truth regarding his mother or not. The expression on his face shows the desperation of a guy who wants to make his mother happy.

The acting is first rate. The acting makes it seem like they are real people and they completely immerse themselves into character. Mukesh as the slimy Gopalakrishnan has given a great performance. The scene where he explains the truth to mannar mathai is heartfelt and feels real. These are the kind of scenes which make it a classic. Another scene is the scene where he phones his mother who lives in an old age home. This scene is classic and the expression on his face when he is asked for a blanket is absolutely hilarious! Saikumar as Gopalakrishnan has given a great performance and I feel he is one of the most underrated actors alive today. It is a pity he wasn't able to use this opportunity to get other good movies. Again, the scene where he confronts Gopalakrishnan should be mentioned as the comic timing is impeccable. His line ""ivan full time kanjiya"" is one of the most popular lines in the history of cinema today. Mamukoya as Hamsakoya, a man who Balakrishnan is indebted to, is also a popular character for all Malayalees. His line ""eda balakrishna"" in that traditional Malappuram accent is one of the most referenced lines in Malayalam cinema. Innocent as Mannar Mathai is the actual centerpiece of the film and he is my favourite comedian. The scene where he loses his mundu is hilarious and this is also one of the scenes which I play over and over again. The other performances in this film cannot be ignored. Devan as Urmees thampan is also another highlight as he was known to do mostly villain roles in those days. Here he gives a heart rending performance as a man who is desperately in search of his daughter. The music is a huge reason for the success of the movie. There are not many songs and the few that are there are good. But the background music is what impressed me so much.

Ultimately what contributes to the everlasting success of the movie is the realism of the characters and the mature comedy(without much vulgarity) that exists in the movie. It is one of my most favourite Malayalam movies.

I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.

Around 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.

Then comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me!

Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.

Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.

Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.

But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.

Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!",2H35M

I saw his 2005 work ""Life is Worth Losing"" before this, and while that was a superior (and longer) show ""Complaints and Grievances"" has plenty to recommend it as long as you realise that a lot of the humour is very tongue-in-cheek, perhaps more so than any other comedian you've ever seen. You can't believe that George really does go around running down people in his car - he's saying it for the shock value and to set up a line of related jokes that are sending up the habits and true intentions of a lot of drivers, things we want to do but social etiquette prevents.

George moves swiftly from joke to joke, story to story, so for the couple of lines that might not amuse there are another half a dozen right around the corner. He covers a wide range of topics and regularly changes his pacing and delivery, which for quick-witted viewers is just fine but it might confound a lot of people who prefer simpler humour and more obvious punchlines. But for me, this is part of his appeal - a unique approach that makes him a cult legend.

Certainly this show will not appeal to everyone - the Ten Commandments ending skit alone is sure to boil the blood of a few staunch Christians, although it makes some valid (and hilarious) points about religion as a system of mind-control. For the people it does appeal to though, they will love it and would be well advised to pick up his other, somewhat better, works.",

Helping Section 9 Chief Aramaki are the child-like Tachikoma robots and a team with expertise in hacking the virtual world called the 'Internet' to locate criminals, led by Major Motoko Kusanagi.

Though all the characters from the Ghost in the Shell movie are here, this film has absolutely nothing to do with the feature, instead establishing itself as a well-written and directed anime in its own right.  There are also some creative decisions that seem to be aimed at making Stand Alone Complex more mainstream (for example, Motoko no longer has to be undressed to become invisible).  The addition of the Tachikoma (from the original manga) may annoy some Ghost in the Shell purists at first, but despite their 'cute' sounding nature, the Tachikoma are ultimately the most emotional and touching characters of the series.

Roughly half the episodes are 'Stand Alone', in that they basically follow the 'case-of-the-week' format, and the other half deal with the 'Laughing Man', a mysterious vigilante-type hacker who seems determined to rid the world of corruption.

Since the glory days of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Trigun and Cowboy Bebop, all slowly aging extremely gracefully, most of the good anime has come from movies, with TV series being left by the wayside.  It's therefore refreshing to see a well-budgeted TV series that mixes the best of CSI and the Matrix, and actually being fun to watch, with the occasional cliff-hanger ending that leaves you wanting more!

To hide his identity, he becomes a mullah (Muslim religious scholar) and improvises as best as he can. The dialogs on theology and Muslim daily life are funny, yet very powerful. This excellent movie is not only a slap to the ruling clergy in Iran, but also a slap to religious fundamentalism of any faith.

All the way they meet all sorts of people, get into trouble, and try to make money. As the show progresses, the mysteries of the characters pasts are slowly revealed.

Samurai champloo is an excellent series from the people who made Cowboy Bebop, the animated sequence in Kill Bill, and a few sequences in the Animatrix. The music is good, offering a wide variety of genres, the animation is excellent, and the dialog is kept to a bare minimum. Oh, and the comedy is great, too.

If you liked Cowboy Bebop, you will probably like Samurai Champloo. One's set in the future and has a lot of jazz music, the other's set long ago in Japan and has a lot of rap in the scene transitions. But the character types in both are pretty much the same, and in both the characters must come to terms with themselves. I recommend it to fans of this genre of anime.",

Everything and everyone gets his goat. Even the simple joys of life unleash that monster that swells inside of Dylan. His persona on stage makes you think that he is better of being left alone, but this is one of the essential ingredients and ironies of Dylan Moran's stand up comedy routine. He clearly makes it clear that he hates interacting with people, yet he feels the need to tell us his pet hates in front of an audience of up to 600 people.

The man himself is a mystery. Unlike Irish comedians like Tommy Tiernan & Ed Byrne when thay are on a television chat show, who would do a questions and answer section after their 10 minute slot, Moran just did his stand up. I know his professional career began in 1993 when he won the So You Think Your Funny competition at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. Critical attention followed in 1996 when he won the Perrier Award. His first sitcom, How do you want me lasted for two series. Nothing else was heard from him till 2000 when he released his cult hit Black Books. Film appearances followed but I have never seen him do interviews and I think this is why I love this DVD. This is the closest you'll will get to a televised interview. However because this is his stage persona we'll never get glimpse at what the real man is like.

Filmed in April in 2004 at Vicar Street in Dublin. Moran's Stand up comedy is very well crafted. What gives it the power is his naturalistic delivery. It comes across that he is just picking these ideas and one liners as he speaks. He is also a master craftsman at working the audience. He makes the audience titter with nervous laughter continuously with his quips and well executed improvisations. This titter spreads like a wave taking everybody in the room with it. Then when you least expect it he hits you with the killer punch line. Not all his stories and observations have a punch line but he keeps everybody on their toes with seductive quips till he lands it carefully. Its like going to the pub with a couple of mates and the conversation you have with them is full of humorous quips till somebody levels the whole lot of you with the one liner to beat them all. That's what it's like at a Dylan Moran show. Topics of the night involve religion, children, rap, and culminates in his observation on how you can spot Irish people abroad.

A definite for any fan of surreal literate comedy.",

And although it is more of a chronicle of an era (the early 1960's and what lead to Dylan's fame) then a biography of Bob Dylan I was surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did. At first I was skeptical, I thought it had pretensions of grandeur: Dylan/and Scorsese? I mean come on guys!? But the piece delivered. It was cut in such a way that seemed to create drama out of raw material. Although ponderous at times the film not only held my interest but made me want to find out more about Bob Dylan, the NYC folk scene, Pete, Seger, Woody Guthrie, Allen Ginsberg, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez and many others. The interviews were fascinating, humorous and sometimes truly educational. There is a purpose and a true sense of that time to the film that is unlike most other ""rock"" documentaries. In one of my favorite interviews in the film Bob Neuwirth explains how in the early 60's money (financial success) was not an issue when it came to the arts. Back then it was about if an artist had something to say. Weather it was Bob Dylan or Ornette Coleman what people would ask was ""does he (the artist) have something to say."" Money and the ""bottom line"" didn't enter into the equation. It was a whole different world back then. Neuwirth states this so glibly that you'll wish you had a time-machine to go back and check it out for yourself. I have at least one friend who was disappointed in the film. He felt that it didn't illuminate the life of Dylan enough in that it ends in 1966 with him being ""booed"" offstage for ""going electric."" But apparently this is all Dylan wanted to reveal for this film. He (and his people) gave Martin Scorsese specific instructions to only chronicle this period. Scorsese was asked to sort through hours of material (including 10-hours of recent Dylan interviews). The result is amazing considering these limitations. Instead of illuminating the Dylan myth the film uses ""myth"" to stir a powerful narrative, one that rivals many of Scosese's latest cinematic endeavors. Perhaps another director would have tried to create something more definitive regarding the details of Dylans life and songwriting process but Scorsese has always favored myth over reality in him films. And in the case of No Direction Home I believe he mixes together the perfect combination of myth, mystery and reality. Sure there are great Dylan performances throughout the feature but they are tied together by a larger narrative which is the journey of an artist (at a particular stage in his life). Some of the highlights for me musically and otherwise were Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival where he has trouble tuning his guitar but still comes off as some sort of ""folk messiah"" to the folkies present ( was that scene even real?! ), Al Kooper talking about how he came up for the organ part for Like a Rolling Stone (hilarious). Dylan performing (if only snippets of, sigh) ""Masters of War,"" and his ""Hard Rain"" and the final performance of the film (Like a Rolling Stone) when Dylan summons his band (the Band) to ""play it f*ck#ng loud!"" in order offset the hecklers booing his electric set in England in 1966. Ironically I recently read a quote from Jim Jarmusch talking about NYC in the late 1970's, he said, ""I feel so lucky. During the late 70's in New York, anything seemed possible. You could make a movie or a record and work part time, and you could find an apartment for 160 bucks a month. And the conversations were about ideas. No one was talking about money. It was pretty amazing. But looking back is dangerous. I don't like nostalgia. But, still, damn, it was fun. I'm glad I was there."" Be it the early 1960's or the late 1970's perhaps the charm and ""myth"" of such an era inspired Dylan and company to chronicle only his ""golden era"" as opposed to trying to trace his entire career ( which could have proved to be less then fruitful ). Instead we get a wonderful slice of life about a great time in American History, about a great artist and put together on film by a great filmmaker. I'm not going to complain.",

With only Frank knowing Sullivan's identity and Queenan and Dignam knowing Costigan's, a race begins with the first one to expose the other winning.

Having enjoyed the original film, I was quite looking forward to this film and not really worried that Hollywood would mess it up. In a way it does deliver but it is hard to ignore the problems and failings in the film and if I didn't realise how IMDb put together their top 250 list, I would be amazed that the film is running so high up it. The original was a tight cop thriller which I remember thinking owed much to American cinema in style and tone, so surely America can only do it better? Well, if not better then this is certainly bigger, with stars oozing out of every pore, a big director and a long running time. In regards the latter, the film should be commended for moving slickly through the 150 minutes and not feeling as long as it is. The fact that it is cool, engaging and quite exciting will be enough for most audiences and indeed the sheer volume of positive votes on this site shows it has struck something of a chord, but this is not to say it is a classic and those putting it alongside Goodfellas are simply out of their trees.

The script here tries to give more room for growth to the characters, to explore their feelings outside of the tension and fear of their situation. Unfortunately this produces many scenes that are a bit dull and unconvincing as they attempt to deepen the material. Specifically I am talking about the thread involving the girlfriend, her scenes add little and the dialogue in the session scenes is obvious and, as a Sopranos viewer, I was surprised by this. A secondary downside of this (although not totally to blame) is that it is not as gripping and claustrophobic as I would have liked. Yes it is thrilling at times but I wanted it to be consistent like a real cat'n'mouse game with the noose tightening palatably around each character's neck as they raced to hang the other first. The ending is also a little less effective than it should be because, added to the original's strong ending is an extra scene that doesn't have a strong foundation and is not as good as it should have been.

Ironically for such a starry affair, some of the performances are a bit weak, and I'm thinking specifically of Damon. He never seems like the flipped version of Costigan and I never really got the feeling of him being trapped, panicked and hunted in the same way as his opposite number was. Conversely then DiCaprio is pretty strong and is convincing as he loses himself into Costello's gang of murderers. He works well alongside a scene-stealing Nicholson. At times he threatens to completely tip over into ham but for the most part he is just larger than life and provides a lot of energy to the film. This energy is harnessed well by director Scorsese who directs with this usual eye for a setup and also an enjoyable soundtrack. The use of sudden stops in the music and quick cuts is perhaps a bit much to get used to but it is strangely effective. The support cast is impressive in depth but they are not all that well used. Walhberg has all the best lines but it seems like he has wandered in from another movie at times and, funny as he was, he is never the developed and involved character that he needed to be for the way the narrative required. Baldwin is the same although he is more restrained and fits better, while Sheen is a nice touch of class. The woman playing the girlfriend is as weak as her material and although she did have an important part in the story, she adds very little beyond the writing on the page.

Overall though, this is a strong and professional film and it is a shame that it isn't as good as I wanted. The attempts to paint detailed and complex characters makes it interesting but not as convincing as it needed to be  with Damon in particular left out there with little to work with in comparison to DiCaprio. The moments of slick tension and action are very good though and the only downside was that it made me wish for more of the same and that Scorsese had focused on keeping it tight and taut in the same way that the superior original had.",2H31M

In truth, Hurricane Katrina struck the Mississippi gulf coast and south Louisiana, visiting upon those areas a thirty foot wall of water. New Orleans, on the edge of the weaker northwest quadrant of the storm, was merely brushed.

It is a point which WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE brings out early: New Orleans received at best a glancing blow and it should have survived. The great disaster which befell the city was not so much natural as man-made. And throughout the documentary's four hour run time, director Spike Lee not only presents a kaleidescope of interviews with survivors, he repeatedly returns to the inevitable question: how did it happen? Much of the answer to that question depends on who you ask. New Orleans has a history of blowing levees, and early in the film several people state flatly that the levees were deliberately blown in an effort to protect the city's wealthier districts at the expense of poorer areas. But although director Lee gives the idea play, it soon becomes clear that no such effort was required: it was in fact a mixture of bad design; neglect; an unwillingness by city, state, and federal officials to spend the money; and, most simply, indifference toward the people of New Orleans and indeed Louisiana in general.

WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE is truly devastating in its portrait of a great American city's collapse. Interviews with survivors, archival footage, and news reports paint a damning portrait of failure at almost every possible level. Most damning is the picture of federal inaction. While people drowned in their attics, President Bush was on vacation. While people collapsed from heat prostration and dehydration Condoleeza Rice bought shoes at an upscale store. The minutes became hours, the hours became days, and the cavalry simply did not arrive.

Spike Lee is a somewhat problematic director, an artist who has the very distinct tendency to interject race issues into scenarios whether such is warranted or not. In this particular instance, however, I believe Lee is on target when the attributes federal inaction in large part to the fact that New Orleans is predominately poor and black. Had he gone further to note the obvious fact that the city is also of the deep South--a region that has typically been ignored by Washington--he would have struck a bull's eye; it is worth pointing out that south Mississippi, which is predominately white, experienced the same federal foot dragging and ridiculous mismanagement.

When all is said and done, WHEN THE LEVEES broke is a stunning but flawed portrait of a horrific disaster that befell a great American city--a city which, as of this date, has yet to begin a significant recovery and which will very likely never again be the New Orleans of legend and song. It's great strength is that it allows the victims to speak for themselves; it's great failure is a tendency to posit race plain and simple as the cause of federal indifference. It was a mighty factor, to be sure, but nothing is ever quite as simple as all that.

The DVD release includes three disks. The film itself offers a commentary by Lee; the third disk consists of bonus material that further elaborates what is indeed an American tragedy. In spite of occasional flaws, I recommend it very strongly.

Probably that accounts for the huge amount of movies without any coherent screenplay that India churns out. Black Friday, on the other hand, is an exception, which will make any film maker proud.

The movie, revolving around the investigation following the horrifying Bombay bomb blasts, and also showing the perpetrators' lives just before and after the incident, took a long time to get through the Censor Board, and it's not difficult to imagine why once you have seen the movie. The movie tries to portray everything the way it actually happened, or at least as the book says it happened, and succeeds. Technically the movie is top league, compared to other Hindi movies, though the editing is choppy in places. The music, by Indian Ocean, is brilliant, and more importantly suits the plot. Despite the length of the movie the director never loses grip, and that's really commendable.

I haven't seen Satya (and I am sorry for that), so I am not very familiar with Anurag Kashyap's work (though he also did the dialogues, I believe, for Yuva, which I have seen), but considering the smoke he generates with every movie, I knew there had to be some fire to it too. And Black Friday IS fiery! The movie doesn't ever try to be politically correct and the director is almost obsessed with showing everything - even the correct language - which shall make it unsuitable for family viewing.

The actors, with Kay Kay (he should be getting awards for this one) and Aditya Srivastava worth special mention, do a very good job too, and I think many of them are of a theatre background, which ensures a high pedigree in Indian movies. Those familiar with Indian TV serials must have seen Srivastava in an eminently well-made series called 9 Malabar Hill from the late 90s, which also starred Pawan Malhotra. Srivastava has been seen in many other smaller roles in movies and TV serials since then, but that particular role had showed how good an actor he is, and it is proved here once more. Pawan Malhotra is also a known face in India's parallel cinema movement, though he is prone to overact at times. Kay Kay is one of the best actors to have hit the Indian screen in recent years, and brilliant performances aren't new to him.

The movie is unique in the sense that it shows the life of a terrorist AFTER the blast and how he copes with all the pressures. Then there's the pressure faced by the investigators to get to the terrorist, but taking care at the same time that they don't harm innocent people in their zeal. When I saw in the credits that the movie was based on a book by a Muslim author, I started feeling that it was going to be a biased description of the atrocities of Mumbai police on innocent members of the Musilm community during the investigations. Such a thought process is shameful, but natural in India's circumstances. But surprisingly, and thankfully, the movie, and so I suppose the book too, is as objective as it could have been without appearing sympathetic to either of the parties.

To finish off, this is one of those (very rare) movies that convince you that the future isn't all that bad for Hindi cinema. A must watch for all Hindi movie fans, and even those who normally don't watch Hindi movies because of the unrealistic gloss and song-and-dance routines.",2H23M

It doesn't matter whether you like (or even understand) baseball, or ever set foot in Brooklyn, or whether you were alive in 1957, when the Brooklyn Dodgers suddenly disappeared, and major league baseball came to California.

To be sure, this is the story of a baseball club and the community in which it lived. Told not just through beautiful use of film, still photographs, and sound clips, but also through riveting comments from a lot of people who aren't kids any more, but who seem transported back to another era by recalling when life and the Dodgers were pretty much indistinguishable from each other, a time when the priest at Sunday mass would tell the congregants that there would be no sermon on that hot summer day -- and that everyone should go home and pray for Dodgers first baseman Gil Hodges to get out of his hitting slump (which he did). The viewer sees and hears present indignation and horror in the voice and the face of a 70+-year-old at the fact that his 5th grade teacher to allow the class to listen to the final game of the World Series.

But it is also the story of America, and particularly post-WWII America -- the era of ""the boys of summer"" that began in 1947, the year that Jackie Robinson became the first black man to play major league ball (and the NL's Rookie of the Year), and President Truman spoke out against discrimination based on race and color and began the first federal study of civil rights. (Robinson played the lead role. The president followed, at a distance.) Adeptly and entertainingly (though yes, a nearby box of tissues may be necessary), the movie's makers show us effects of suburban sprawl and urban decay, the culture of the highway and the automobile, and the end of cheap and efficient urban mass transportation, and the growth of the United States into a nation whose important cities stretched from sea to shining sea-- not just as far west as St. Louis.

In between songs, concerts, and interviews (The quartet Amiina also participates in the interviews), there are clips of the country and towns of Iceland. You'll see its mountains, its towns, its fish factories, and its beautiful landscape, which, in my opinion, appropriately fits the music of Sigur Rós.

There isn't too much wasted interview time, rather much of the film is spent on the crowds; their faces and their reaction to the music. My only complaint is that some of my favorite songs weren't played. Still, they couldn't have fit everything into it. There isn't a song by them I don't like, and that's a rare thing from one band.

It was impressive to see such giants as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Benjamin Franklin, as well as the lesser known individuals, truly inhabited by the actors.

The challenge of the series was to breathe life into those stories and lives we know so well. The filmmakers worked closely to David McCullough's outstanding book for the details, along with the human side of the story captured in the voluminous correspondence of John and Abigail Adams. The political, military, and personal issues were all thoughtfully brought to life. The design values of the film were also superb. Nothing looked stagy or stilted in the sets and costumes, which provided an unusual authenticity of period style for television drama. With each appearance of George Washington (David Morse), it was hard not to gasp due to the believability of his character.

The drama of America's breaking from England for independence was an improbable story and one dependent on the courage and idealism of the individuals portrayed in this film.

Simply put, we need more people in our country right now just like John and Abigail Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Washington, Knox, and, above all, the ordinary human beings heroically portrayed in this fine film!",

I first picked up the book while I was traveling home on leave shortly after returning from Iraq and read it in one sitting on the plane. One of the things that I find to be the most outstanding about the book and the series so far is that it is true to the people. I don't mean that it gives us something new and authentic to ponder. I can't think of any instance where the book or show goes into the political aspect of Iraq. And you know why. Because Marines don't make policy. They enforce it, regardless of there personal feelings towards it.

I am personally tired of hearing the comments about the show being cliché' If they spend anytime around the military they will find that most of characters portrayed are just like the young men serving. Marines are a different breed. They are asked to do different things that most of society would not understand. Enjoy the show and try not to get your mind wrapped around it to much.",

this show is bound for great things. my only concern is that every show that i love gets canceled because not enough people get it. (Firefly, Arrested Development, Freaks and Geeks).

The film is economically produced--C.K. does his own direction and editing--and spends much of its time in a mid shot of C.K.'s face; content is everything here.

Whatever its personal implications, C.K.'s recent divorce is a great development for his comedy: it allows him to take his trademark pessimism on dates, to the gym, and even to the club. He pares incredulous contempt for beautiful people with his own healthy self-loathing--but because this is Louis C.K, he absolutely never pities himself. In fact, many of his best barbs are aimed at the entitled and ungrateful among us: among other great jabs, this film contains his now-famous ""chair in the sky"" airplane routine.

Much of his best and most human material is derived from life as a father; he invokes his daughters with a disarming love and respect, while realistically explicating the more disgusting elements of parenthood. This too benefits from his recent divorce, as it serves to alienate him even further from contemporary dating.

There is also a fair number of shock laughs, of course--at one point C.K tellingly acknowledges that upsetting people makes him laugh. And that in itself is the great appeal of Louis C.K.'s comedy, that we can bond over the idea that nothing good will ever happen to anyone and then find humor in it. Hilarious is all about finding laughs in pessimism, and it demonstrates what a hilarious performer C.K. is. -TK 9/22/10",

This story for me was personal on many levels. I am Colombian; I grew up in Medellín in the 1980s. I went to school with Andrés Escobar's fiancé. And I was at the Rose Bowl in 1994, when Andrés scored the infamous ""auto-goal"" in a failed attempt to prevent the ball from going into the net. As I drove to the theater last week, I could feel my emotions gathering up in my chest, and old forgotten wounds felt suddenly brand new. I've tried very hard not to think of that day in June of 1994, but I remember it well. Even though the disappointment was palpable, there was no shame in our defeat. I was proud of our team! It was difficult to feel proud of anything Colombian in those days. Perhaps it was fortunate that I didn't yet know of the insurmountable amount of shame that would fall upon all of us a few days later, on the day Andrés was killed.

I've lived in the U.S. for over 25 years now, and I've learned to suppress pain and anger when both strangers and friends make ""funny"" drug related comments in my presence. Few non- Colombians have been able to grasp the magnitude of the damage Andrés' senseless murder caused. It wasn't about ""bad sportsmanship"". This was more than another black mark on our well-tarnished national image. The death of Andrés branded all Colombians as savages, it vanished the role models of millions. It stole the hope of an entire nation. It made us all infamous!

The Two Escobars utterly surprised me. Although the title might suggest an emphasis on the similarities of these two men, it really highlights the vast difference in their moral fiber. Two young American brothers were able to weave this documentary, that eloquently expresses what an entire nation hadn't been able to verbalize in over a decade. The Zimbaslist brothers didn't tell us what happened. They showed us what happened using Colombian footage, using our own words, interviewing the surviving protagonists—villains, heroes, and victims alike. The documentary is well balanced. They not only show the horror of what we Colombians have lived through, but also how far we've come. I am so immensely grateful for this film, and to Michael and Jeff Zimbalist for their commitment to tell a story that wasn't their own. I want to dare everybody I know to go see it, not because it paints my compatriots in a good light, but simply because it is honest and enlightening, and I hope it shatters some tiresome stereotypes. It's important to remember that every time we label something or someone based on a generalization, we betray our own ignorance. Every story has a Pablo Escobar—a despicable characters that makes headline news—but fortunately every story also has someone like Andrés Escobar.",

This is one of the biggest islands in the world with a natural world unlike anywhere else. It's millions of years since it was separated as Africa and India drifted apart. It's a four part series. The first three parts have the standard beautiful nature cinematography with the last ten minutes of each episode showing the struggles of the filmmakers. The beautiful pictures are unforgettable. The ten minutes are sometimes interesting but it could still be cut down a little bit. What I find most compelling is the knowledge that this is a disappearing world. Everybody knows about the lemurs but this is an island onto itself. It is possible that this world will go the way of the elephant bird.

The last episode tells the story of the extinct elephant bird. In 1961, David was given giant shell fragments from a village boy. When he pieced the 3D puzzle together, it formed a nearly whole giant egg. It is the egg of an extinct giant bird which Marco Polo mentioned. With stories of the bird carrying off elephants, the bird is given the name elephant bird. While this episode doesn't quite have the beautiful nature shots, it tells the compelling extinction story which nicely wraps up the sad scary truth. I know very little about the island and it's sad that so much of it may never be known.",

They weren't afraid to try new genres, such as a cartoon soundtrack (Flash Gordon), to rockabilly, funk, lovely ballads, pop and hard rock. Guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor are both excellent storytellers. One of the nicest things is that all four band members wrote the songs. The bassist John Deacon wrote some of their killer melodies and riffs (Another One Bites the Dust, Under Pressure) and guitarist Brian May wrote some of the smash hits such as We Will Rock You. I gained new respect for Roger Taylor, who not only is an excellent drummer (especially live) and songwriter, but was a key singer on most of their songs. And of course the doco is a wonderful tribute to the late Freddie Mercury. His charisma, his great singing, but also his piano playing.

Cousins Ulster brogue requires a little getting used to and much of this is his (well informed) personal opinion, but if you can stick with the low budget, stylised camera work and editing it is a joy. The descriptions of various styles of cinematography and editing as opposed to film text and meaning is inventive and informative, very different to the often imposed micro analysis you get from film studies text. I loved hearing cousins say things like ""...deep space, shallow focus...single take, no fast cutting..."" I soon found myself looking at films thinking Cousin-like about what I Was seeing on screen.

I learnt about how different directors and cinematographers influenced each other, how styles emerged, faded, and reemerged. How new directors from different countries, influenced by Hollywood, reshaped those ideas and created new personal films reflecting the psyche of their own nations. Cousin's odyssey is like a poem, his narration is often abstract yet personal. But it is exciting and informative, a different take on a subject history that all to often is written in stone.

When the end credits started rolling one sentence came to my mind: ""This is how science should be taught"". In schools, in books and on television. So many people feel repelled by mathematics, physics or chemistry because they have been introduced to it the wrong way. Students are asked to memorize definitions and equations, but they are rarely if ever told how the theories they are taught in school were devised in the first place. Observations and experiments are the heart of every theory that aims to explain how the natural world works, and they are the ones which give the most insight into how things work.

""Shock and Awe: The Story of Electricity"" is about those landmark observations and experiments which have increased our understanding and mastery of electricity (and magnetism) over the centuries, and which have allowed for technological innovations that have become ubiquitous in our lives today: light bulbs, radio, phones, computers, and everything else that depends on electricity. We take these things for granted, and we tend to forget that barely 200 years ago our civilization had none of it. Imagine if we were born in a time when none of these technologies existed, how amazing it would be to learn that we can light our homes at night without burning oil or candles, or that we can send messages to people on the other side of the ocean in a matter of seconds as opposed to weeks or months.

Presenter Jim Al-Khalili's love of science shines through, as he recreates historical experiments and tells the story of the protagonists who made it happen. Most of the big names are there: Volta, Galvani, Cavendish, Faraday, Franklin, Maxwell, Hertz, Edison, Tesla, as well as many other important but not so well known figures. The exposition is clear and logical. You do not need a background in physics to understand what is said here, in fact I feel like I have understood more about electricity and magnetism during the 3 hours I have watched this documentary than during the many years I studied the subject in school.

A couple of times the shell model of the atom is invoked to explain some observed phenomena, where the electrons are shown to ""gravitate"" around the nucleus. This model has been known to be wrong for nearly a century now. Al-Khalili does state that this was the model used at the time, but I don't remember him explicitly saying that it is now outdated. Usually I would remove one star, but the rest is so perfect that I cannot get myself to give it less than 10. This documentary makes you understand how many things we use every day work, and it makes you want to keep learning and participate in the advancement of science. School never did that to me. 

When I have kids I want to show them things that will make them dream, that will stimulate and open their minds, things that will leave them with memories they will be glad to have, be it books, travels, movies, music or documentaries. Carl Sagan's Cosmos is one documentary I have in mind to tell them about the universe. I'm now adding ""The Story of Electricity"" to the list. Watch it for yourself, and show it to your kids (provided they are not too young as the dissection scenes might be a bit disturbing), if they are any curious about how things work they will love it!

I can confidently say that by the end of Samsara, I once again experienced the flick of a light switch in my mind. Everything I am was completely put into perspective. As a result, I can promise that Samsara will leave you both awestruck and completely terrified. 

Samsara struck a very personal chord with me. Much of what is shown exists because of people like me. The film is an unfiltered walk through the things that I try my best to ignore in daily life. I'm not sure how to reconcile the imagery of Samsara with how I live my life. I'm also not sure that I want to.

Clearly this documentary is one-sided, being strongly in favor of medical marijuana (and presumably marijuana legalization in general). There are some attempts to show how crazy some marijuana devotees are (the ones in the ""cult"" of marijuana). But basically, there is one message here.

I would like to have seen a discussion about the difference between marijuana and the chemicals inside it. Can marijuana be taken in other ways than smoking it? Can the chemicals be isolated and made into a pill or vapor? Critics of medical marijuana would be less opposed if they saw it as a real medication and not as a drug. (And, really, it is hardly healthy to smoke anything...) One person does say it should be FDA tested, to which I would agree.",1H40M

That being said, the dust may finally be settling and it's now time to look upon the Second World war much like any other period of history with an unbiased and impartial view that does not emphasize nor downplay the atrocities or achievements of either party involved. This is how we look at every period of history and it seems we can finally begin to look at the Second World War the same way.

This TV series is visually stunning, it aims for historical accuracy while still having decent amounts of action and excitement. It doesn't feel so much like the war propaganda from the earlier post-war years or even more recent films like Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers where the Germans are depicted as evil Jew hating monsters with no compassion. Those films themselves were not bad, but ""unbiased"" is not a word that could ever be used to describe them.

Another wonderful aspect of this series is simply that it's taken from the German perspective, with German actors speaking German instead of American or British actors with some speaking with German accents and some not. It adds to the overall look and feel of the series. It also doesn't constantly have sad violins playing to black and White images of the holocaust. as if to say that anyone living in the West has not heard about the holocaust at least once every single day of their lives. Band of Brothers for example has an entire episode dedicated to just the holocaust.

Overall this series is deeply engaging and a breath of fresh air, you're not constantly beaten over the head with reminders that Hitler and the Nazis were cartoon super-villains and the holocaust was the single most important event in human history, completely overshadowing mush less significant events like the Holodomor, the Soviet massacres and the Communist Chinese massacres to name a few. It also gives a rare glimpse into the German side of the story, remember what I said about being impartial?

For similar films I would recommend Das Boot, Cross of Iron and Stalingrad.",

Most compelling is that many answers to the problems of food production, pollution, environmental degradation, and disease are already here and in use, if only people would listen, become informed, and buy wisely.

I had some idea, but not to the extent shown in the film, of soil's importance. I really had no idea that the solutions to our problems lie well within our grasp if only we can change our ways. 

Somewhat explored in the documentary are the ideas that a tremendous amount of inertia lies in current practices, both in terms of government regulation which favors agribusiness, and in terms of perception resulting from public relations campaigns and advertising these multinationals use to preserve their profitable business model. 

However, the film does not come off as a political diatribe, but only as the accumulated wisdom of many experts in the field, both academic and working organic farmers.

I recently watched the Friday 13th documentary His Name Was Jason (2009) and wasn't exactly impressed with what I saw.

How can a person like myself who found the franchise lackluster enjoy a documentary about the material? Well, I did. This documentary is so in depth, so thorough that I was positively fascinated. Giving around 30 minutes of stories, background and factoids about each movie the documentary stands at over 5 and a half hours so isn't swift viewing.

With countless interviews from the creators and cast to unseen footage and deleted scenes this is one of the most competently made fan service documentaries I've ever seen and is a must watch for any fans or even just horror addicts like myself.

Want to know why some of the movies were so cut? Interested to find out why Kane Hodder didn't play Jason in Freddy Vs Jason? Eager to discover which movies succeeded and which bombed? This documentary covers these questions and so much more.

Brilliant viewing and that's coming from someone who as mentioned doesn't consider the franchise as critically acclaimed as most others.

The Good: 

Corey Feldmans opening and closer 

Essential viewing for fans of the series 

Extremely in depth 

The Bad: 

Uses the same interview segments as His Name Was Jason (2009)

However, after watching 2 episodes I was quickly disappointed in the content. The series supports the notion of Oswald being a lone gun man of the JFK assassination. No mention of the Church Committee findings that the assassination involved more than one shooter.

It has been completely proved that the Zapuder film was edited before it was released to the public.

Oswald & Jack Ruby had clear connections of working for the CIA.

Vincent Bugliosi makes it obvious. That he is a liar along with Dan Rather and Walter Cronkite. We have several high level government officials lying about the events on the day of the assassination.

Spending much time on calling anyone not supporting the official propaganda conspiracy theorist trying to make money off the event.

Anyone who has spend time researching the published literature such as Assassination Science by Dr James Fetzer. Can clearly see that the official story of the assassination is a fairy tale.

This series is just more social engineering/propaganda to support the establishment view of history of which the majority is based on lies.

To start off I will say it may be slow and to different for some to enjoy and so that I warn you. Now I will say that I can not express the idea enough of how surprising this film is. Jk Simmons does an outstanding performance as the highly unpredictable hair trigger tempered teacher Fletcher, Miles Teller an actor who I've only seen in mediocre comedies also shines in a breakthrough performance as the ambitious drummer Andrew. The performance are outstanding and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

My favorite thing about this film is how it has created it's own one of a kind spot in the music genre of film, it's atmosphere is unlike any other as well. The idea that this film is one of a kind can't be stressed enough, I guarantee you cannot find another film out there like this. This film expresses a shockingly high intensity for a music film. I believe that Jk Simmons acting is what fueled a lot of the intensity. When you watch this film even though it's pace will seem slow to most it's intensity is impossible to miss. 

I can see how a lot of certain people may find this film hard to enjoy but for me this film as slow as it is couldn't have been more intense. The mere fact that a music film shows some strong intensity like this one did is mind blowing to me. I don't know how many of you had this same experience or something similar then you already know what I'm talking about. I have a good feeling and I'm hopeful this film rakes in some acting Oscars because this film deserves at least one. I haven't read anything on this films page and I'm sure others have expressed similar opinions and all I can say is listen and trust me.

ADD (attention deficit disorder) approach?

really?

1. there is no deficit disorder in the film. 2. the film is not multiple thought impaired.

advice to that publication and mr. scheck:

a. do not go past go. b. do not collect $200.00. c. go directly to jail.

perhaps ""they,"" as the media elite, are so accustomed to red medicine, mr. chow, spago's, boa, the polo lounge, scarpetta at montage, etc. the reviewer cannot comprehend the seemingly, insidious insurmountable inequality due to our elected employees serving in jobs to serve we the people yet they serve wall street.

""democracy's high stakes,"" indeed, is the underlying theme by director/writer/producer John Wellington Ennis.

regardless of how many times the cancer of our democracy is written about, i. e., money in politics, the vast majority of we the people still do not truly grasp the underlying horror of how little democracy remains in actuality vs. principle.

the constituency is primarily clueless as to how to connect the dots due to the systematic dismantling of the middle class under ronnie the rotten commencing 01.20.1981 {read: 'sleepwalking through history: America in the reagan years}. 

the inherent value of Pay 2 Play is that it provides a broad overview of what happens when a person is a statesman vs. a politician. 

tragically, Mr. Ennis, shows that we now have one political party entrenched with two (2) different names as this film details.

the film demonstrates how our elections are nothing more than ""insiders"" vs. ""outsiders"" vs. we the people.

do the math: 

315,000,000+ Americans vs. 545 elected/appointed employees: 


* SCOTUS = 9 - WH = 1 - Senate = 100 - House of Representatives = 435 


to serve at our pleasure since, in theory, it is a government of the people, by the people and for the people.

to the credit of Mr. Ennis, he has two women as executive producers: Holly Mosher and Rebecca Lynn Minkin. 

please attend a screening and/or watch this film. watch it again to take notes. then: 


* spread the word – far and wide. - host this film - take action.


please recall that the civil rights movement changed the course of our nation in ten [10] short years AND they did it with nothing more technological than: 

1. a mimeograph machine and 2.a rotary phone.

This looked quite normal the first time around when watching it, but then the 6-7 time watching it you begin to realize there is a deeper meaning, a easter egg! This scene is in fact referring to a game called ""Paul Of Duty"" number 6 ""Sack Ops 2"" in a dlc map pack called Buried, deep underground buried in a western town. In the game we see a ghost playing the piano just as fuzzy did in ""too many cooks""! 

There are many other easter eggs as well, such as when fuzzy shoots rainbows from his hands. At first you may think it is just an ordinary scene, but as you get into the deeper many we realize this is actually miming a movie called ""Harry Potter"". Just as harry (the wizard in Harry Potter) can do spells and has an owl who delivers his mail the owls name is whodini the character fuzzy can perform a magic that includes love. Harry potters mom loved him very much and used love to shield him from Voldimorts spells, just how fuzzy used love to create the rainbow! But what really is love? Is it in the sky?

If the previous Doctor Who actors tried to do a show like this the hour they would not have been as effective. Only Capaldi could pull this off so well. I am not saying the other Who actors were unfunny, just that their humour could never carry a whole episode like this.

It is based on true incidents which became a novel named ""Lock Up"" by M. Chandrakumar. Well that explains the crux of the tale but what makes it more solid and interesting is the chilling screen play and 100 % pure cinema type of handling where there was no absolute space for commercialism. Hats off to Director Vetrimaran who has dared to experiment this genre which reflects the ruthless, impolite, merciless, callous nature of some police officers. The plot gets enhanced by the performers like Dhinesh, Samuthirakani, Kishore, Adukalam Murugadoss and some more actors whom we hardly know by their names. The thrashes that these boys take up looks so vivid, raw, brutal, inhuman and clearly I understand this movie will be a hard to digest fact for soft or weak hearted audience. So people of this sort you are warned better try some comedy in the next screen. On the technical front the cinematography and BGM also shows the pain. This movie is a clear warning that there is a corrupt system out there waiting for innocent prey and if we are caught it is like the hell's hole and no escape.

Even though the episodes of Horace and Pete feel formatted more in the way of a play, to me it is still fantastic in the same way. Family and life can be infuriating because as we grow up we see that the more we know about family/life/universe the more we realize that we don't know (that whole Socrates thing), but that doesn't mean we give up hope ... instead we can find it absurdly funny and laugh in the face of absurdity, and try and learn from it, and move forward in a better way, especially when there is a master funny man like Louis CK to extract amazing funny thought lines from the absurdity. In this way it is an honest reaction to the confusing nature of life instead of simply trying to create a sanitized narrative to our lives that might make us feel less fear, but doesn't really address the reality. Anyways, that is more my emotional mumbo jumbo response to why I think this is a really good show, but in more specific terms I find the dialogue really great, the acting great, and the jokes great, and therefore I find it ... very great!

Story is simple straight forward police and gangster cat and mouse or I could say hide seek game. 

The wow factor is the screenplay which is well crafted and characterisations are well etched. The perfect pace stands out first kept the audience thrilled and guessing till the end. Dialogues are sharp as knife and powerful as the gun shots in the movie. The BGM was rock solid which had added the feel to the play. 

Coming to the performances Madhavan as Vikram the protagonist a perfect police maintains his grip and emotes intensive emotions particularly when he feels he was used. Vijay Sethupathy on the other hand essays antagonist Vedha a most wanted leader of local gang pulling it off effortlessly seriously effortlessly like so much of assaultness the way he carries himself stands out unique particularly. Loved the in between short stories he threw. Both Madhavan and VJS with their exposed grey carried on their roles picture perfect. They present raw psychological thriller duo. All the other support characters were picked perfect. Varalakshmi's plays an extended cameo but stands out as well the new face lady who plays the lawyer and wife of Vikram. 

Subtle messages on guilt - revenge - emotions of gangster or the police were the special catch.

But then I heard they made some changes to the story for the stage adaption and then I became very skeptical. 

Once I finally got to see the show LIVE in person, I was blown away by the entire production and loved the small changes they made. It actually fits better as a live production and the changes were PERFECT. 

Once the show and road tour ended, I was so sad to know we'll never get to see this again, but once it was announced that they are bringing the Broadway production to the BIG SCREEN, I was more than excited.

Seeing the cinematic version of the Broadway production gave a whole new perspective on the experience. The drama seems heightened since we now get to see close ups of the characters and every emotional reaction and response. We also get to HEAR every line and word, where on stage, sometimes the lines are run together rather quickly and it's easy to miss certain elements. The lighting, the sound, the editing was BRILLIANT! 

Also, the actors were full of extra life and energy and you could see their love and passion for each other and this show. This theatrical experience was OVERFLOWING with Disney magic and I confess, I teared up several times, just because it was SO AMAZING!

If you never saw a Broadway show, or can't get to New York, and if you never saw the Broadway version of Newsies...this is a MUST-SEE! The Music, the Dancing, the Acting, the Performances, the Costumes and Set....everything was SHEER MAGIC and absolutely PERFECT!

A man travels around a city with a camera slung over his shoulder, documenting urban life with dazzling invention.",1929-01-08,"experimental film,soviet union,avant garde,city symphony,eye",8.4,Oblomov_81,2002-01-29,"Dziga Vertov's `The Man with the Movie Camera' begins with a prologue that explains that the director is attempting to stretch the boundaries of the cinematic medium, trying to achieve `a total separation from the language of literature and theater.' It accomplishes this by throwing out conventional storytelling and taking a non-narrative approach. Basically, the entire film consists of different series of shots that illuminate day-to-day life in Moscow and Odessa. The periods of the day- dawn, working hours, and resting hours- are represented by the activities of the ordinary people that make up the `cast' of the film, while the activities of certain citizens are contrasted with activities of others to create a panorama of Russian urban life in 1929.

The first thing we see is a projectionist threading film through the spools of a projector. An audience pours into the movie theater as the seats magically flip out; this stylized movement establishes a sense of choreography that will frequently reoccur. The projector comes to life and images appear on the movie screen.

Now we see the details of a woman's bedroom. The camera starts by focusing on her window, then moving inside and examining her belongings, such as pictures that hang on the wall and items scattered on her dresser. The woman herself rests in her bed. Then we gradually move outside to see the world in a seemingly frozen state; streets are empty, the parks and benches are unpopulated, telephones are silent, and the wheels and gears of the factory remain still. More people are seen resting in their beds. Then a solitary car moves out onto the street with a cameraman perched in it, and, as if the filmmaker was signaling the start of the day, the city comes alive. The woman wakes up, begins washing herself and attending to her appearance, and flickers the shades to her window. Intercut with this are the images of trolley cars leaving their stations and moving about in synchronized motion, as well as people arriving at factories to begin labor. The gears that were previously silent begin to shift and churn, and they grow more and more rapid in movement as the film progresses. Similarly, there are images of a train moving at high speed, quickly intercut with images of crowds in parks, cars streaming through the streets, and telephones buzzing with activity. They make the working hours of the day seem all the more hectic.

Another interesting aspect of Vertov's editing is the way he contrasts the upper-class members of society with the lower-class. One scenario involves the residents of a barber shop: women get their hair primped while men sharpen razor blades for shaving. This is intercut with images of workers in a factory: women get their hair dirtied as they shovel coal, while men sharpen axes for chopping. Shots of trolleys moving about in various directions are placed in almost every sequence, to convey the idea of people moving constantly, anywhere at anytime.

When the working hours end and the resting hours begin, the gears come to a sudden halt and, moments later, we see people's bodies at rest, this time on the beach. Athletic events are photographed in a way that makes them seem energetic, but still allows for slow-moving photography to show that such activities are intended to be relaxing. We see a buff athlete jumping a hurdle; his expression is very animated, but his body moves with slowness and ease. We see families on a merry-go-round intercut with bikers on a motorcycle track. Eventually, we are back in the movie theater, where the audience watches joyfully as stop-motion animation shows a tripod and camera moving about on their own.

There is no actual `story' to Vertov's film. It is an attempt to use the camera to capture things other mediums of entertainment, such as books and plays, cannot. It is fascinating for its dazzling technical skill, and noteworthy for its movement towards a new cinematic direction.",1H8M

On the surface, satirizing something as solemn and horrible as Nazi Germany could be misconstrued as rash. But Chaplin's brilliance isn't limited to making a joke out of everything. In fact, the seriousness of his message wouldn't have been nearly as valid if not for the excellent use of humor in this movie along with the moments of stark drama blended in. Drama alone wouldn't have had the bite and resonance that this film did. Laughing at someone (Adenoid Hynkel) can be the best way to attack them, while laughing with someone (the Jewish Barber) can be the best way to love them. In the Jewish Barber's final speech, I forgot for a moment that the war he was talking about happened more than half a century ago. They are words that have meaning now, and in any time of war. For this reason I believe the film did far greater good than harm, as it still has the same profound effect today.",2H5M

A wheelchair-bound photographer spies on his neighbors from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them has committed murder.",1954-11-15,"neighbor,wheelchair,voyeur,apartment,amateur detective",8.4,Aidan McGuinness,2002-11-12,"Ah it's a movie that's in IMDB's Top 20, and it has good reason to be. For starter's let's look at the simple premise - James Stewart is L. B. Jeffries, a photographer who is currently recovering from an injury on assignment. With his broken leg he's stuck in his apartment, with nothing better to do than spy on his neighbours and be visited by his girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly), his officer friend Wendell, and his nurse, Stella. Jeffries observes the coming and goings of the various apartments he can observe (from his rear apartment window) and it is one of these - a Raymond Burr - who draws his attention because. could it be that the man has committed some heinous crime? Let's find out.

One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment. This would seem claustrophobic but Hitchcock never inhibits us like this - he lets us escape through Jeffries binoculars and camera lenses, and his roving camera swoops down to let us see what the characters see (but never, thankfully, anything more than that - this is how you do suspense!). The set design is wonderful - the apartment is just the right size and is nicely laid out. However the real praise is for all the other apartments visible to Jeffries - an actual habitable set with multiple stories where characters can be observed only as they pass by their own windows (yeah, they don't care much for curtains). There's a sense of individuality gone in to each home, despite the fact we can only see barely elements of each. This is helped by a nice, differing range of characters inhabiting each and going about their daily lives - there's a mini soap-opera contained in the movie, all observed at a distance. Excellent stuff.

Acting? It's great here. There's some nice depth to the characters here, with them feeling like actual real people rather than slick one-dimensional tags. Stewart is very proficient in this type of role - he was born to it - and Kelly proves she is more than just a pretty face, managing to effuse her character with both grace (*groan*) and steel. Even supporting characters like Stella are good (she has a wickedly black sense of thinking that's hilarious). What's so incredible is that the characters we observe from a distance in the other apartments (and with whom we never actually interact with) have as much depth as most main characters in movies nowadays. Excellent script and acting in this movie.

I've already praised Hitchcock's set location and camera work, so I won't prattle on about him much more. He does a stellar job here and, in my opinion, this is the best piece of work he's done (that I've seen). It's virtually flawless and you're never let down (or bored). Well done. It's a shame he lost out on an Oscar (although he did have tough competition that year with `On the Waterfront').

`Rear Window' is a great example of how you can successfully have sharp acting, script, and directing and not feel the need for a slew of swear words and gratuitous violence. Regarded as a classic, and deservedly so. 9.1/10",1H52M

The story centers around a prosperous family that was disgraced due to the father's progressive ideas (fairness and equality for peasants). With the father in exile, the mother and 2 young children must undertake a difficult journey to join him, but they are ambushed by bandits and sold into slavery. This is the story of each family member's determination to reunite.

It's an excellent film, well deserving of all the praise it has received. In terms of cinematography and visual poetry, it's the kind of film where each frame could be a photo to hang on your wall. Shots are carefully composed with perfect balance, and although it's in black & white, we get the full, layered spectrum of every grey known to the human eye.

But as you watch this, here's an interesting tidbit that may enhance your interest. Pay close attention to the roles of women in the story, because that's what makes this work fascinating as not only a social statement but as a psychoanalysis of the great director Kenji Mizoguchi himself. At the time of this film's release (1954) and certainly in medieval times, women in Japan were horribly oppressed. Even in folk art, drama and literature, their characters traditionally played subservient and 2-dimensional roles. But here Mizoguchi turns that upside down, in a subtle way. Our 2 heroines (the mother and daughter) are, despite their physical limitations, the strongest of character and will, and they are the ones propelling the story forward. This mirror's the director's personal experience and, evidently, his private pain.

Raised in poverty, Mizoguchi witnessed the struggles, sacrifices and ultimately the determination of the women in his life (mother, sister) who suffered in order to give him the opportunities he needed to succeed. If you keep this in mind as you watch this, I guarantee your appreciation of this film will be expanded. Much like Mozart's famous opera ""Don Giovanni"" was his catharsis over his own father's sacrifices (and tyranny), here in ""Sansho the Bailiff"" we get Mizoguchi's heart open wide, showing us how he perceives the women in his life as the fighters, the rebels, the spirits of determination, tenacity and sacrifice. As a social message, this film certainly delivered ideas ahead of its time, but perhaps more poignant is the rare peek into the mind, the demons and the secret debt he felt he owed to those who taught him the meaning of strength.",2H4M

In fact, I would resist from picking one or even three films that 'speak for Ray'- but I would be lying if I said I didn't have a favourite. Aparajito is a wonderful work of art, an extremely moving melodrama and a remarkably accurate portrayal of adolescence. Of course, it would be shameful to give all the credit to Ray. Bibhuti Bhusan Bandhyopadhaya's novels (Aparajito is adapted from the last part of Pather Panchali and the first half of Aparajito) are meticulously descriptive and Ray's success with the film owes much to the simplicity and honesty of his source. But there is something in Aparajito that belongs exclusively to the cinema - something that has to do with the the mixture of distance and intimacy in the movies, of identification and unfamiliarity. You want to feel like Aparajito is a film about you, but you secretly admit that it isn't, it cannot be - because you experience it outside yourself, in Ravi Shankar's beautiful music, in the photography that oscillates between banality and the deeply metaphoric, in the wonderful performances (especially by Karuna Bannerjee), and finally in Ray's masterful vision in putting it all together.

This excellently staged and wonderfully acted production is as much an acting showcase for Douglas as it is a directorial masterstroke by a young Stanley Kubrick who adapted this to the screen from a novel based on actual accounts.

Kubrick displays a great control of sound effects and camera movement in the brief but effective battle scenes that expertly depict the controlled chaos that was trench warfare during WWI. Things get juicier during the ensuing courtroom battle where the deafening disparity between the elite who propagate and profit from war and the common citizens who suffer and die in war is shown with great lucidity.

Unlike later Kubrick epics, this runs at a crisp 90 minutes, though suffers briefly from a slow and awkwardly staged opening ten minutes before Douglas comes on screen. Ultimately, this holds up very well to modern scrutiny thanks to the flawlessness of Kurbick's craft, the amazing ensemble acting, and the surprising depth of its philosophical and psychological pondering.

Poor, hungry peasant Macario longs for just one good meal on the Day of the Dead. After his wife cooks a turkey for him, he meets three apparitions,...",1960-06-09,"character name as title,forename as title,one word title,death,turkey",8.4,insomniac_rod,2006-12-23,"I am ashamed to admit that I didn't find about ""Macario"" until 2000 when it gained some attention because ""Amores Perros"" was about to get nominated for Best Foreign Picture at the Academy Awards. ""Macario"" went to the spot light because it was Mèxico's first movie to get nominated for such an award. So I took away my prejudgments towards classic movies and I tracked down a ""Macario"" DVD.

And I am extremely glad that this movie has worldwide recognition because it truly is one of Mexico's best movies of all time (if not the best).

""Macario"" is more than a fairy tale with macabre overtones such as displaying The Devil, or The Death. No, ""Macario"" has a social and humanitarian message PLUS it displays in a beautiful way Mexican culture towards the dead and how we (Mexicans) feel about Death. There's also a strong criticism against authorities and noble titles in the 18th century. This movie is rich in all the sense of the word.

Meet Macario, a Mexican campesino or land worker who isn't completely happy with his life because he desires what rich people have; specifically, eating turkey. Macario works hard for his family but it isn't enough for establishing a life full of comfort.

One good day, Macario's wife gets a turkey for him; a turkey that cost her a lot of effort and work. Macario is thrilled and delighted with it and decides to eat it all by himself, not sharing it. He walks too far until he gets tired and takes a rest in the woods. On his eating turkey journey Macario meets Satan, The Death, and God. The three iconic figures want a bite of that turkey but Macario won't share it. But Death makes a deal with him... a deal that will give Macario all the power, money, fame, respect and all the turkey goodies he always wished. But in exchange for what? True, he will be the savior for many souls but will also risk his own soul.

I don't want to give much away from this wonderful piece of cinema. It is a tender tale with dark overtones and Horror references but to be honest, this is more of a fantasy story displaying interesting facts of Mexican culture.

Ignacio Lòpez Tarso delivers an amazing performance as Macario. That's all I can say about him. He's the master. Also Pilar Pellicer delivers a great performance. Too bad that she committed suicide at such a young age.

The direction is flawless and sometimes looks way ahead of it's time. The same with the fantastic art direction and cinematography. The final scene where Macario is in front of thousands of candles it's a visually stunning and rich piece of art direction and cinematography. A memorable movie designed to charm everybody.

Please watch ""Macario"" if you haven't. You won't find a better Mexican movie than this. It has everything to become a favorite.

To be honest, I haven't seen it in 3 or 4 years but some scenes just keep repeating in my memory. This is a memorable movie in all the sense of the word. This movie makes me proud of being Mexican.",1H31M

An executive of a shoe company becomes a victim of extortion when his chauffeur's son is kidnapped and held for ransom.",1963-03-01,"house on a hill,detective,ransom,chauffeur,japanese law enforcement",8.4,Quinoa1984,2004-08-30,"High and Low, like Yojimbo and Throne of Blood, combines elements to create something special while seeming rather routine- while Yojimbo seems like a bad-ass samurai flick, it has the ingredients of a western and satire, and Throne of Blood is a rather faithful, strange adaptation of Macbeth in the guise of a warlord/samurai tale, High and Low does a similar method. Akira Kurosawa, a filmmaker who gets film buff's ears lit up at the mere mention of him, can usually be counted on to keep a film interesting even if it may not be entertaining to some of the crowd that likes a section of his movies or another (there's usually a split between his samurai/medieval tales and epics, and his dramas about the tragedies of ordinary people). 

Here he finds a middle ground- the story is taken from a hard-boiled detective novel, the kind you could probably buy for a quarter or fifty cents in the old days- as he tells of two stories interconnected at the hip, both with detail a commercial Hollywood director would brush off. The first is of businessman Gondo (Toshiro Mifune, with his usual bravura presence, but with enough nuanced and quiet moments for two movies), who is about to close a deal to get the shoe company he's worked for for years, when he gets a phone call. There's been a kidnapping- not his son, but his chauffeur's by default. Backed into a corner without options, he gets together 30 million he really can't afford, and gives it to the kidnapper(s). The police, meanwhile, are not about to give up, and start digging for clues with an in-depth investigation that goes to probe every possibility: the chauffeur's son used as a partial witness with drawings; a car; a trolly car; all this leads to nothing and everything, leading to a third act that's as riveting as the first two.

Although the acting by everyone involved, cop characters included (Tatsuya Nakadai and Yutaka Sada are surprisingly good, the later even with limited screen time), Kurosawa keeps the film deliberately paced. Another director (more modern perhaps, but maybe not) might cut to the chase quicker, cutting past most of the investigation details, and even the emotional high-points in the first act. But Kurosawa is as interested in the nature and details of what the police do as he is with the compositions, which are constructed and framed as only an artist would do. The film creates a superb juxtaposition as well- Mifune's Gondo is enraged about what will happen with his money, but his morals stand above everything in his business affairs. Meanwhile, the cops here aren't cruel and unforgiving, but professionals trying to crack a case that the audience can hang onto. And then when the ""seedy"" underbelly of the city comes into view, it's looked on with at least some compassion by Kurosawa, and it's not too over-the-top.

If all your looking for is thrill after thrill, like in Sanjuro or even Hidden Fortress, look elsewhere- the violence, by the way, is kept to a low level for this one (it'd even be quite suitable for kids, if they don't mind the subtitles and quintessential intensity in the Japanese style of film acting). But for tight, often gripping suspense in the IL' 'whodunit' mystery tale, this is a keeper. Manipulative, perhaps, yet in the hands of a master it's an exemplary deal. And, in the end, it even provides a sad, existential kind of conclusion as good and evil become blurred as the kidnapper looks through glass at the disillusioned Gondo. It's one of the great endings in world cinema. A+",2H23M

Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it).

In a world where pettiness abounds to see the big-hearted nature of the main characters and how such compassion literally changes people for the better -- you're going to want to see this film.

For years I avoided this film (like IKIRU) because it was not a samurai film. But after getting over those ridiculous reasons, I finally figured I needed to complete my Kurosawa education by seeing it.

And boy was I glad I did.

It is one of those films that does change you. Like every classic it stands the test of time not because of its entertainment value but because it is a great experience. Even months after seeing the film the first time I found myself always examining my own life against the noble attitudes of the main characters.

Presumably dead at the end of the first book, charming and irrepressible Ostap Bender  who respected the law and knew hundreds of legal ways to make people part with their money (Sergey Yursky, the best screen Ostap) was resurrected in a sequel, ""Zolotoy telyonok"" (""The Golden Calf""), an equally humorous but more serious and sharper satire on the drawbacks of the Soviet System. In ""Zolotoy Telyonok"", Bender discovers an ""underground Soviet millionaire"", Alexander Koreiko (Bender meets his match in the seemingly plain and insignificant accountant with 46 rubles per month salary Alexander Ivanovich Koreiko) and blackmails him in hopes to extort one million rubles and fulfill his ""crystal"" dream of moving to Rio de Janeiro.

It is a story a dying man who looks at life with a positive attitude and enjoys his time knowing  fully well his disease is incurable and that he is going to die soon.

Rajesh Khanna as Anand is absolutely brilliant, this is his career-best performance , notwithstanding movies like Kati Patang, Roti, Aradhana, Amar Prem etc. You cannot think of any other actor in this role and to think Rajesh Khanna was not the original choice(Shashi Kapoor was). He makes you laugh and cry. He causes anxiety and goose bumps. Simply superb.

Amitabh Bachchan is fantastic as babumoshai( a name with which Raj Kapoor used to address the film's director Hrishikesh Mukherjee). He showed the world that the next superstar was coming, though he really ""arrived"" a couple of years later. The rest of the supporting cast is also brilliant be it Johhny Walker(stands out) or Ramesh Deo or Seema or Sumitra. Everyone is wonderful.

Music is the hallmark of all great hindi movies and this one has music ranking right up there, on the top. Be it ""Kahin door jab din dhal jaye"" or "" Maine tere liye hi saath rang"" or ""Zindagi kaisi hai paheli"".

 Maverick composer Salil Chowdury comes up with an absolutely fantastic score and singers Mukhesh and Manna Dey do complete justice to his tunes.

About the director Hrishikesh Mukherjee, what can one say, he is one of the best directors ever in the Indian film history. A guy with a complete repertoire,a complete entertainer (though people consider other  directors to be more entertaining, but real movie buffs will agree with me). All his movies, he has been directing movies since 1957 are worth a watch. Some are brilliant and others watchable.

Having watched it many dozens of times, I have observed that the movie and Ray's treatment of his story is unique in many ways. Firstly, given the exotic locales in the story, any director would lap up the opportunity of using stunning angles for shots around the various forts (of Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner and Jaisalmer in this case), let the camera hover around the desert horizon with the sun setting or the static ripples of sand on a dune. Never for a moment had Ray let the camera linger on any stunning backdrop outside the context of the film. Even in the sunset scene at Ramdeorah railway station, the camera does not lose the subject, that was 'jatayu' loosening up after an arduous camel ride. Even more interesting is Ray's ability to stay focused to the story line again given that the climax inside the Jaisalmer fort, a classic fort with a town inside. It would be easy for any one to yield to the temptation of extending the final moments of the film in the fort in its numerous small streets that wind around the beautiful houses of the town within the fort. However, Ray stuck to telling the story as it was in the book (with some changes of course) where the ""Golden Fortress"" itself occupies a few minutes of the 120 minute film.

One thing I love about this series is how touching it all really is. The marriages of the slaves, the jobs of the slaves, and the story about Chicken George is just very cool. I know to some this series is just very depicting, and to some whites, they feel it's making them responsible for slavery.

The Sherlockian story is called ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band"", about a deadly snake with curious coloration.

But the subtitles! A few typos and misspelling were not that bad. It did not bother me too much that Stamford became Stanford. On the other hand, StockMoron was bit much for ""Stoke Moran,"" the house where the adventure takes place.

But then, Helen Stoner, sitting at 221b, describes her situation and death of her sister, which shown in flashback. The subtitle of the dramatic moment, when her sister collapses and says her dying words, was, ""A motley ribbon"". Sherlock Holmes then repeats back ""motley ribbon"" to make sure he got it right.

As a Sherlock Holmes aficionado I'd long heard the series of Soviet TV films that ""The King of Blackmailers"" belongs to praised as one of the best versions of Holmes put on film. Now, thanks to the magic of the internet, I've had a chance to view one of the films, and I can't say I think people were exaggerating very much.

Vasili Livanov might not be the very greatest Sherlock Holmes I have ever seen, but he is legitimately excellent in the role. He makes a very good-humored and genial but also quiet and in-command Holmes, and harnesses a huge amount of screen presence. It's just an excellent and absorbing performance, and one that very subtly but thoroughly humanizes Holmes. For all Liavnov does for Holmes, though, I can't say I have seen a better Watson than Vitali Solomin. He injects a certain vitality and enthusiasm into the role so that we can really understand how this Watson has turned his cases with Holmes into a series of widely popular magazine stories -- especially in the scene where he returns to Baker Street to describe Milverton's house to Holmes.

The two of them have an excellent chemistry together as well, and this, along with the writing, infuses most of their scenes together with a wit and humor that's quite wonderful and also serves as relief from the tension of the rest of the story.

The adaptation, which inserts Sherlock's brother Mycroft Holmes into a version of Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton"" works very well, and keeps the suspense and adventure in a story that, in fact, revolves more around Holmes almost being implicated in a crime than solving one.

The direction is also to be commended -- frequently spooky, tense, and unsettling, with uneasy stillness used to great effect. The whole thing looks, gorgeous too, with very lavish sets and location work. I admire how seamlessly the Victorian England of Sherlock Holmes' world was creating in the Soviet Union using all Russian-speaking actors, and I'll be watching as many English-subtitled entries in the Lenfilm Holmes series with Valili Livanov as I can locate.",

We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!

Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.

Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.

Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. "" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. "" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) "" Truck? What truck?"" ( and then later ) ""Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. ""

Sola ) "" How? "" ( Indy ) I don't know I'm making this up as I go.""

Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.

Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.

Loosely based on Antonioni's 'Blow Up', ''Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro' has achieved the cult classic status over the years. Even though, in my opinion, it has dated a little, it's still hell of a lot funnier than most Indian comedies of the last ten years.",2H12M

It is truly challenging to present the tensions in the family along with the innocence of the children Gulzar and Sekhar Kapoor (the director) delve deeply into the psychology of the adults and the children. Urmila excels as a child artist (she was barely 10 years old!), so did Anuradha and Jugal Hansraj.

The camera work in the movie is simple and artistic. Rahul Dev Burman's haunting score couldn't be any more apt. It is really striking, he used variations of a single tune as the background score for the entire movie! Wow! That is not the best part, you don't notice that! That's the best part.

Nasseruddin Shah and Shabana Azmi, who are known for their extreme potential and they have played their roles to perfection.

I would say this is Sekhar Kapoor's best. There are several scenes in the movie where the characters convey their feeling by a simple ""act"" which would otherwise need 1000 words and not-needed melodrama. That is clearly his directorial genius. When the characters actually ""speak"" they convey their feelings equally well...Thanks to the genius and maturity of Gulzar and Sekhar Kapoor.

The movie is funny, beautiful, tense, moving, complex..... However, I have one complaint with the script.

Warning: If you plan to watch the movie do not read beyond this  point!



The open question remains as to what is really the punishment to a man who made a mistake as big as adultery. We know the man is good, loves his kids and wife and his work. He did make a mistake. The situation in which he made the mistake, no matter what, cannot be justified. He made a mistake. That's it.

The kid has no fault of his and he is lonely and helpless and feels deprived of everything. Does he have to suffer because the adult made a mistake? No. So, what is doing justice to this kid? Keeping him along with your kids? If that is the case, what is the punishment to the father? If you send him away as

punishment, the kids will all be fatherless and the wife will have the burden of taking care of them alone.

So, as shown in the film...the correct punishment is the one that makes him remorseful and the correct thing to do with the kid is to bring him up along with the others. OK, so far so good but this soln. has a problem too. What happens when the kids grow little older. They know their ""brother"" made no mistake, they will learn that their father...about who they were so proud..has let them down. This will certainly effect them for life! Even if we assume their family friends can forgive his mistake, the kids cannot. Not at least these kids.. may be some kids who are in a family that is used to adultery!

Well, one could argue that the father indeed made a mistake and the kids would have to simply face the truth..there is no other way out, so they rather stop worrying about it..and of course they don't to need to worry about punishing his father if the objective is to make him remorseful.",2H45M

A screen version of the works of the famous English writer Arthur Conan Doyle about the adventures of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr. Watson. Well, here is the penultimate part of the Soviet series of paintings, sad of course, because I love it very much, like the original source, which I read several years ago. And here's my short opinion - The Best Sherlock Holmes. Do not expect an analysis of the minuses here, since there are none, because petty quibbles due to the fact that everything was filmed not in London are simply inappropriate here, so let your humble servant tell you about the expressive merits of this part of the magnificent series. So, here they are: 1. Atmosphere - there is even more of it than in the previous parts, or so it seemed to me. And the manner of shooting is to blame for this, where shots of real London were combined with filming locations. It may not look too chic today, but it works, you can't argue with that. And the costumes, furnishings, decorations - all once again plunge the viewer into Victorian England. The creators did not drop the quality bar - I praise for that. 2. Investigation - the main business of our duet is to search for damned treasures that bring misfortune to their owners, in parallel Holmes recalls the most curious case that left an indelible mark on his heart. Holmes is so focused and thoughtful that he was able to furnish ""That woman"" who shook his foundations, and this is an achievement. Yes, and Watson's treasure hunt gave an unexpected result. Perhaps these two investigations are the most emotional in the entire series. Well, they do not end quite usually. 3. The finale - it is sad to some extent, because in it our heroes do not discuss Holmes's conclusions while sitting by the fireplace with a glass of brandy, but summarize. At this moment, it becomes heavy on the heart, because you understand both of them, but what happened will forever change both the doctor and his friend. Well, the final shots summarize this investigation and the past tense. Sad, gentlemen, sad! 4. Wonderful actors - just to list a few: Viktor Proskurin (who recently left us) as Tadeusz Sholto, Borislav Brundukov as Inspector Lestrade, Rina Zelenaya as Mrs. Hudson, Larisa Solovieva as Irene Adler (That woman), and of course , the main celebrity, without whom this investigation would have reached a dead end - the bulldog Bambula as Tory. 5. Music - this time composer Vladimir Dashkevich decided not to experiment with music, but left everything as it is - and it still works great. A little about the main characters: 1. Sherlock Holmes performed by Vasily Livanov - a brilliant London detective who always solves any, even the most intricate crimes. Cold, honest, until he meets Irene Adler, who awakens hitherto unseen feelings in Holmes. I would venture to suggest that this is love, no matter how long Sherlock disagrees with me. This is it. The thief, who was supposed to be part of his filing cabinet, became the ""Achilles heel"" of the great detective. Even Sherlock Holmes was able to captivate a woman, albeit far from simple. Vasily Borisovich again skillfully performed his famous role. Bravo! 2. Dr. Watson performed by Vitaly Solomin - Sherlock's friend and biographer. This investigation became key for him in his life, because he also fell in love, however, unlike Holmes, he cannot hide it. His act in the finale is justified and honest, but sadness will not overshadow this, unfortunately. This is the truth of a harsh life, because we do not always get what we want, because the truth! Vitaly Methodievich again got used to the role of a doctor, and how he played falling in love is simply impossible to forget. Bravo! 3. Mary Morston performed by Yekaterina Zinchenko is an unfortunate orphan who turned to Sherlock Holmes for help, not knowing that this business would forever change her fate and she would meet Dr. Watson. Catherine just superbly succeeded in this image. Her appearance is the best fit for a young graduate of a private boarding school with excellent upbringing and well-placed manners. And again, bravo! Well, there is still one more part, which I will tell you about next time, already in the new, barely come twentieth century, where our heroes have to neutralize the elusive German spy, and not only. As a result, we have an excellent detective story about Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, about the search for damned treasures, with the most expressive feelings, wonderful music and atmosphere, as well as amazing acting work.",

The story of a gang's rise from the prohibition years to the 60s. The film's main 2 character's are the focus of the picture. Without trying to spoil it, the film addresses 3 distinct eras in their lives.

The film explores the heart, Noodles soul. A man struggling with himself, someone who plays evil acts, a man who sees the pure in his childhood sweetheart. A man never at peace.

The film is directed by Leone, a master of his art. I'm a huge fan of his work. Each of his films got better and better, and Once Upon A time In America was a picture which had all the experience which he achieved in the 60s. It's almost a gift to himself.

The film's locations are stunning, authentic and dirty.

The screenplay is excellent, but the direction makes the film. Maybe one or two characters were underwritten, but it seems that the director wanted us to talk about the picture, discuss the possible loose ends, make up our own minds. Leone's methodical pacing is stunning.

The acting is tremendous, can't praise James Woods and Robert De Niro enough, awesome!

The photography is beautiful, it lacks colour giving it a gritty look, perfection!

Morricone delivers another masterpiece, his score adds further depth and backups the director's story.

Even the new actors who acted as the Harris clan and especially Rosemary Dunsmore as Katherine Brooke delivered their best. Megan Follows is as brilliant as she was in the prequel - with her perfect rendition of Anne, she has clinched a place for herself among contemporary actresses who have been so true to their literary characters example, Kellie Martin - Christy, Jennifer Ehle - Elizabeth Bennet etc. She's a truly gifted actress. Jonanthan Crombie gets a better chance in this sequel to establish himself as the one and only Gilbert Blythe.

Little did I know, at the end of August, I would witness my own display of ""near death."" 

My grandmother was admitted to the hospital after suffering a massive stroke and became so uncontrollable, in a tizzy of psychotic rage, she had to be detained to the bed and given dosages of a sleep drug. Turns out, my grandmother turned unconscious and, while she was able to breath on her own, she didn't seem to have much control over her movements. She couldn't speak, and all we could do as her family was stand by her and witness what could very well be her last moments. I spent hours in a hospital, alongside my unbelievably distraught grandfather, my restless, sleepless aunt, my own stressed father, who was left to make the decisions on what to do with my grandmother, my devastated cousins, my nurse mother, who'd come to the rescue of breaking down difficult information, and additional family members express grief and devastation to such a fit of heartbreak.

I'd like to say I'm digressing from the actual film at hand, but I believe Wiseman wants us to somewhat reflect on how we'd respond in this particular quandary, as well as try and relate an experience we've had where it was like staring death or ""near death"" in the face. Wiseman takes us inside Boston's Beth Israel Hospital, specifically in the intensive care unit, where dozens of competent and qualified medical personnel work to diagnose, treat, and console patients and their family members. These patients are admitted in the particular unit for the obvious concern - they need intense, uncompromising care, for these could, fearfully, be their last moments alive. Some have cancer, some have heart issues, some have poor lungs, and some are just coming to terms with their age. Whatever the case may be, this is a difficult time, and the news usually brought forth is negative or faintly positive.

Wiseman unsurprisingly doesn't examine medical debates such as universal healthcare, or even really dig deep into the concept of the afterlife, heaven vs. hell, and so forth. There's no place for that kind of debate at this moment in time. Wiseman wants to focus on the immediate present: what we can see, what we can hear, what we can observe, monitor, and digest about a loved one and what can we do to assure their health is maintained and their current state comfortable? Wiseman, in addition, captures everything through a black and white lens, as bleak as possible, complimenting much of the information we hear from doctors and loved ones throughout the course of six hours.

While few scenes in Near Death aren't sad, one of the most soul-crushing is seeing a doctor telling an elderly man that his lungs are in such poor condition that, while they'd like to put him in intubation (a process using a machine to restore competent breathing before being slowly weened off a patient so he can breath on his own), the staff feels that doing so would only confine him to the machine and make him dependent on it. The man sits there, lying in bed, with a blank look on his face. There is no emotion in this scene other than the emotions shed by the viewers. One could view this as a simple slice of life: we're born, we live, we get older, we shutdown, and we die. Others will view this as a depressingly human state of affairs. I say it's an inevitable tragedy that still nonetheless strikes an emotional chord.

The final hour and a half is mostly dedicated to examining a man, who has been admitted for similar reasons in that he is beginning to lose strength in his organs, mainly his heart, liver, and kidneys, and that is making his vitals - blood pressure, blood sugar, heart-rate - all operate in a poorer state. We see his long-devoted, ostensibly long-suffering wife, sob in front of a careful and compassionate doctor by the name of Dr. Taylor, as he sits by her side, quick to answer, or respond, to her many questions and concerns and offer additional options. Dr. Taylor and the woman speak for sometimes twenty minutes at a given time, frequently through the final hour and a half of this documentary, and they are some of the most human dialogs I've ever seen exchanged on film.

This is one of the many scenes that shows the true compassion and skill of the medical personnel all across America. These men and women, some old, some fresh out of medical school, some with the title of a 'doctor,' others playing assistant to the man/woman with the title, but their daily activities range from changing fluids, observing vitals, writing reports, or scratching backs of patients not equipped with the strength or energy to do it themselves. Not to mention, these doctors engage in some of the hardest conversations imaginable, arguably some of the hardest and rawest ever committed to film. Their compassion and soul shouldn't go unnoticed, albeit the incredible amount of information existing in this film.

Near Death is, admittedly, exhaustive and sometimes tedious, as expected with almost every film spanning one-forth of a day.

The impression of the drawings and videos is very rough - it seems that you feel sand between your teeth. Those dark unshaved pirates are making dreadful smiles, they point big guns at you, they play electric guitars and perform rock compositions. Have you seen a pirate with a Mohawk? It's here, too. But it must be so.

This cartoon is the perfect adaptation of Stevenson. It concerns real men (brutal strength is essential) and ambiguously funny situations. For many Russians it is one of the favourite cartoons ever. Its atmosphere (""kick-'em-all"" plus ""don't-be-a-greedy-sob-like-pirates"") is one unstoppable crusher. This cartoon can be described as a train of non-stop gags spiced by a large portion of great (not just good, but really great - in music and in words) songs. The songs make very solid statements about smoking, drinking, and being greedy.

For any boy to watch this cartoon is a must. It is for all audiences, but has a rocketing satire combined with healthy childish humour. Maybe, girls will dislike it. No surprise: it has no female characters (with an exception of a few seconds dedicated to some Donna in the window and the presence of females in one music video about physical training - that's all), it has too many fights (gunfights, fistfights, trunkfights, rapierfights, and even some cool martial arts sequences), it also has tons of gin being consumed, and thousands of cigars being smoked. The pirates, who are drunk and constantly smoking, are being punched, kicked, stabbed, thrown into the sea from the cliffs, and so on. But don't be fooled: this animation can teach you a lesson or two, or even a dozen. Does, for instance, ""Finding Nemo"" has a chance to beat ""Ostrov Sokrovishch""? No, it does not (my opinion, of course). This Russian cartoon has faded colours (in its original version) but it has a big heart and a rushing pace. There is music enough to be an attractive material for two CD albums while the voices of the characters are the best choice ever in the history of animation. Does anybody have a chance to fall asleep while watching ""Ostrov Sokrovishch""? It's easier to die than that. The cause of death will be a super attack on one's sense of humour and on all other senses (if there are some, of course).

Personally, cannot wait for re-watching it again. If Mr Stevenson were alive, he would be hopping with happiness and joy. Why so? Reply: excellent interpretation of the book. After this cartoon all films and animation features with similar ""pirates"" topic seem to be dull and unimaginative.

All has been said: an astounding 10. Thank you for attention.",1H16M

By the time Prime Suspect 4 came about, but for the rare scene it had become virtually identical to a common copper flick.

The first series, concerning the serial killings attributed to George Marlow (With accomplices), is the most complex and riveting, more so than even Cracker's first series.  I have seen the episodes through their completion on several rotations and am still finding subtle aspects of character and plot.  Helen is integral and can portray a paradoxical human in every episode consistently.  Almost as integral is Marlow who can just about convince you that he's innocent -- but not quite, not in the right way.

In the Prime Suspect world, everything is politics.  La Plante examines the seperate realms of politics and how they interact; this is what makes up most of the running time and all of my interest.  Physical details and clue tables are pushed to the side to examine one person's brain, how it reacts to the world, and how the world reacts to it.  Politics, Jane, that's what it's all about.",

I was actually told very much about the movie by my brothers before I got the opportunity to see it myself. And when I experienced it myself, after all it was as good as they claimed, if not better.

In a happy family with music heritage, Nedumudi Venu is Mohanlal's brother and guru, and an excellent singer. He reigns in the family and in the society with his music. But because of his addiction with alcohol, he loses his control over the music and people start prefering his sishya and brother Mohanlal. Considering this as an insult, he starts hating his brother and strives hard to recover from alcoholism. Unable to accept his defeat, he sets to get out of his habit by going on a yatra. Parallely Mohanlal, getting to know that Venu is killed in an accident, is forced to conceal this truth because of their vocally disabled sister's marriage. Mohanlal's trauma is sure to cast down any viewer as a matter of fact thanks to his performance.

A good choice of actors and crew, with a good plot. Expressive Mohanlal befits the role. Music blends with the movie and Yesudas has given his best, Ramakadha Ghanalayam being the pinnacle.  I am sure Yesudas enjoys singing for such movies and the his emotional singing adds value to Mohanlal's character in the songs. Choice of Balamuralikrishna for Nedumudi Venu and Yesudas for Mohanlal is just perfect.

The band had just released Tommy, their classic, and seminal, rock opera and at the concert they reproduce it, note for note. 

It's not all Tommy, however, there's a few other classics of theirs, eg My Generation, Magic Bus, I Can't Explain, plus covers, which were a staple of their show. Here they cover Summertime Blues, Shaking' All Over, Spoonful, Twist and Shout and Young Man's Blues.

Great performance by the band, with Pete Townshend to the fore, but with Keith Moon the undoubtable and unforgettable court jester. Plus, he sure knows how to play the drums...

Ultimately, however, it feels like there is something missing, something that was needed to push this concert into the pantheon of recorded concerts. Maybe it was that some of the songs just feel lacking, and not worthy of a The Who's ""best of to that point"". Heaven and Hell, I Don't Even Know Myself and Water seem out of place with all the great songs. I could have done without Young Man's Blues too.

Maybe it is the restrictive nature of playing a rock opera from start to finish - there's very little room for detours and jams.

It's meant as a hybrid of what David was tinkering as the main premise of what his show would be about- mainly him getting into awkward bits of circumstance and everyday things with people (mainly with some embarrassing or just strange results)- and his stand-up routines countered with *real* remarks from Seinfeld and others. Despite what it might seem as too much going on in a one hour show, he makes it work well. The improvisational style later nailed to a T in the seasons to come is a little more primitive here, but Cheryl Hinds and Jeff Garlin are pros at what they do here.

There's also a plot line involving David setting up a special on HBO (hence the stand-up), and then at the last moment stopping to due his ""dead"" step-father. Like all pilots, its got its imperfections, but its perks outweigh the valleys none-the-less. Surprising still at least in having not seen or heard a shred of David's stand-up material before is how it's actually funnier than expected. It almost makes one wonder why there isn't the occasional drop of the real stand-up stuff in the series (but then again, the very Larry David-esquire curve balls on the show are the bits of stand-up theatrical). It's worth it to check out if you're a fan and pass it by one night if by chance on one of the HBO's or on DVD; it might be funnier as well if you know some of the other little back-story bits from the show (i.e. HBO).

Since then I have never come across it. The documentary follows 2 of the first (british?) journalists able to enter the island of Bougainville, in the Solomon Islands belonging to Papua New Guinea, since the island was reclaimed by its local inhabitants. This pristine tropical island is richly endowed with various mineral resources, leading it to be exploited by a huge mining multinational mining company operating in this part of the world (whose name i forget). One day, the islanders take over the mines, destroy the infrastructures and expel the foreign mine employees, and sending a clear message to the outside world. Then followed the successful resistance and defeat of riot police, the PNG army over many years. PNG even hired a SAS-type mercenary unit from England to sort out the embarrassing situation, but they were sent home by the angry under-paid PNG army, at which point the conflict/revolution briefly entered the mainstream media. And since, Bougainville remains under embargo as the world's first self-sustained 'eco-revoltion', yet politically and internationally unrecognised. This documentary shows how the people of Bougainville survived and created an ingenious and functional alternative existence. At the heart of their subsistence lies the humble coconut, providing them with valuable nutrition, lamp oil and home-made biodiesel to run their jeeps around the island, and giving them a upper hand in their fight against the PNG army..I could go on, but my memories are incomplete, and you have to see for yourselves - you'll never have seen anything like it!",50M

What we do have, is superb modern dancing, sublimely filmed. Direction, choreography, dance, music, costumes, lighting, set - everything is a part of an organic and immersive whole. It's a ""total work of art"", as our German neighbors like to call it. Still, it would be wrong to think about the movie as something Wagnerian : the whole atmosphere, aesthetics included, is distinctly minimalist.

This kind of ""less is more"" attitude has spawned a number of egregiously boring performances, just as it has spawned a number of egregiously boring movies. In ""Amelia"", however, the minimalism turns into an artistic triumph. The main set, for instance, is an unremarkable space, as bland and neutral as a white canvas. As the work progresses the hugely intelligent lighting changes the room into a mother's womb, a tunnel leading into light, a tunnel leading into darkness, a tunnel leading into nothingness, a hall of mirrors, a prisoner's cell, a monk's cell, the inside of someone's mind, the inside of your own mind, a ballroom, a grave, an alien heaven, a lover's bed, a hole in the ground, a moving toy shop, a mystic vision, a shard of moonlight ; the room blinks in and out of existence, changes, morphs, flattens itself, becomes so large that you can't see it anymore. It's a master class in set design and lighting.

Videos started becoming a true art form with directors like David Fincher and Mark Romanek, quickly followed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry and Chris Cunningham. The latter three are featured in a DVD series called ""The Work of Director _____"" Until viewing ""The Work of Director Chris Cunningham"", I had only heard of him because of Madonna's ""Frozen"" video, which I find to be astounding. After watching his collection of videos, it is clear that he has a dark vision and immense talent for creating shocking, yet fascinating imagery.

While ruminating over the selection of videos, it is really hard to come up with a favorite image, much less a favorite video. In ""Come to Daddy"" (Aphex Twin) we have an elderly woman walking her dog on the street of what appears to be a European city, when she comes across a television which features a distorted image of Aphex Twin singing the words to the song. Meanwhile, a group of children, all with the Aphex Twin's head on their bodies, run rampant throughout the neighborhood, wreaking havoc until the image comes out of the television in the form of a demon (and a pretty scary one too  Cunningham's makeup and special effects work in various films really gave him great experience) to collect his ""children"" around him. ""Afrika Shox"" (Leftfield featuring Afrika Bambaataa) shows an African-American man, emaciated and hollow looking, walking around a city while passers-by either ignore him or stare. Unfortunately, he begins to come apart  literally. It starts with his right arm cracking off his body and breaking apart like porcelain as it falls on the ground, soon to be followed by his other limbs, until he can't even hop around. While there is an obvious message somewhere in there, the imagery is just stunning in this video.

There are many more amazing videos in the collection (Including Portishead essentially singing underwater and Bjork's all-too-human-looking robots having a romantic moment together), but the static imagery throughout the videos was all dark; even the video that takes place in sunny Los Angeles ends up having dark (yet hilarious) images. Also, the imagination and vision of Cunningham is absolutely fascinating. While he provides these (mostly obscure) songs with images, there is a coldness and detachment from the subjects that I found very intriguing. I'm sure that it won't be long before he is tapped to direct more than music videos and short films. His fellow video directors who are featured in the DVD series went on to direct incredibly imaginative Oscar-nominated films, but I see Cunningham following in the footsteps of David Fincher, and lending his dark and disturbing vision to a great thriller or horror film. Based on what I saw in this collection of short films/music videos, I would attend that movie, sight unseen. 7/10 --Shelly",

Bill's stand-up has aged rather admirably actually, and Part Troll remains his absolute zenith, he's alive with glee at his own humble foolishness. There's also a slightly sharp political ranty vibe that's tempered with a deft intelligence that still resonates. His shrewd comedy songs and the glorious Kraftwerk parody are evergreen (the latter with his auld mate Martin Trenaman & the actor Kev Eldon in tow). It really is a plethora of comfort and delight.

He's the bloke in the pub who has an allotment and has no grand designs except for constructing a harp of his own invention. Harmless, rather admirable, and endlessly lovable. He's the unproblematic British chain that links my teenage years to my current ones and my sincere appreciation for him has deep, deep roots that will likely never fade.",

He has pulled it off again with Summer Heights High, a mockumentary following three different people who attend the high school Summer Heights High.

We have Jonah, probably the most loved character, a 13 year old boy from Tonga who has some big issues. He has no respect for his teachers and he constantly swears and graffitis. His only joy seems to come from Gumnut College where is is developing his own personal story.

Ja'mie is a transfer student from Hillford Girls Grammar School, an extremely upper class school which is totally different from SHH, which is your average public school. She befriends a group of girls and is constantly looking down on everyone and trying to organize events that will lift school spirit.

Finally, there is Mr. G (my personal favourite), an eccentric and very feminine Drama teacher. His methods are odd, he is extremely full of himself and his new musical ""Annabel: The Musical"" is about ecstasy.

We follow these characters and all their misfortunes and aspirations. The show is always funny but it is always realistic. It captures everything perfectly from the state of public schools (no offense), students with ADD, what people from private school are like and how teachers cope with hardships. Chris Lilley is an immensely talented man and I cannot wait to see what he does next.

PROS: Well knit story, although the editing is a bit choppy at times, good cinematography, good script, very true to reality and good acting by Rasheed Naz, Naeem Tahir, Shaan, newcomer Fawad Khan and of course the one and only Naseer ud din Shah. The film leaves you with questions which is more than any Pakistani film has ever done. 

CONS: While this film has made big leaps into bringing Pakistani Cinema on the map of the International Cinema. I just think that a little bit of attention to detail would have made it an exceptional film by international standards e.g. Shan could have lost more weight while in the cell, he still looks like he is working out for a marathon. Iman's British accent is a bit funny. Still a brilliant film and better than most bollywood films because it sticks close to reality and deals with very relevant and sensitive issues.

Note: I just wish that they would have released it in other countries especially in the gulf simultaneously as it would have attracted a larger more empathetic audience than Pakistan. Let's hope it does well in the international film festivals.",2H48M

I haven't seen a new film this richly entertaining, thrilling, touching and satisfying since Spider-Man 2. It is truly the finest Pixar or animated CGI film to date. I can discuss it without spoilers easily because it's one of those films, like 2001: A Space Odyssey, that exists more as a pure experience of the heart and the senses than as a collection of events that we're supposed to keep track of intellectually. Wall-E rises above that kind of unnecessary complication into the same kind of space occupied by dreams and the imagination.

This film is beautifully animated, of course, to that magical Pixar point where even piles of what should be disgusting trash somehow look breathtakingly gorgeous and even fairly realistic-looking roaches look cute. But much more importantly, the heart, the emotion in this movie is unlike anything I've experienced at the cinema since Forrest Gump. Certainly my tear ducts have not welled up while watching a movie this much since then. I fell in like with the character of Wall-E when I saw the trailer. Watching the movie, I fell in love with him within about 2 minutes. Shortly after that, I fell in love with the idea of Wall-E falling in love.

My previous favorite movie romance is Superman and Lois Lane in the original Superman films. The love story, or the love experience of Wall-E and Eve is perhaps the first I've seen since then that operates at and succeeds on that same level. These couples create an uncomplicated, innocent, simple, yet deep and powerful bond. They capture the experience of love at first sight, writ large. They possess an instant chemistry that tells you they belong together from the first time they see one another and makes you root for their relationship throughout the film. Wall-E and Eve share moments together of real cinematic beauty, true hilarity, frightening sadness, frustrating difficulty and delightful satisfaction. It's a testament to the level of genius at which the Pixar storytellers are operating that we feel every beat of this relationship resonate every step of the way despite the fact that the characters are robots that are not modeled off of humans and speak no more than a handful of words throughout the movie (this animated movie is refreshingly free of obvious ""guest star"" voices or any over-the-top stand-up comedians trying to upstage the movie).

Just like in the first Superman films, once you care about the characters as individuals and care about their relationship, it's almost impossible for the rest of the movie not to work. You're hooked at hello. Wall-E adds all the expected complications to keep the would-be lovers from getting together most of the time. There is a truly great ""McGuffin"" that keeps the heroes and villains busy for quite a while (the item in question is something outwardly simple that ends up holding the key to something more important than anything in the world). The pacing during most of these adventures is as breakneck as anything out of the Star Wars films and the action is always staged with crystal clarity. There are several scenes of peril for Wall-E that are reminiscent of that oddly powerful sequence in Short Circuit 2 when Johnny 5 is almost killed. The filmmakers pull absolutely no punches when it comes to running your heart through the ringer over characters you care about. It probably helps that you can do a lot more physical damage to a robot character than you can to a human character while keeping a G rating and still getting the audience dramatically worried about their survival.

Even on top of the action, the emotion, the visuals and the humor, Wall-E goes the extra mile into thought-provoking thematic territory. The film never hits you over the head with anything preachy and doesn't really even outright tell you what its opinions on the subjects it raises are. It also doesn't explicitly lay out explanations for everything that exists in Wall-E's world (there are no ""talking killer"" scenes and very little verbal exposition). I think the bits of ambiguity work here because they add to the sense of mystery, helplessness and alienation that most of the characters in the movie feel to some degree.

There are human characters in this movie too, quite a few. I think that's necessary because if humans aren't shown in a robot world, you have to wonder what purpose were the robots designed to serve? That was a curiosity of the earlier CGI movie, Robots. Most of the humans in Wall-E aren't as developed as the robots, but I think that's because they exist more to represent the whole of humanity rather than particular individuals. We're asked to ponder the consequences of the choices they make as though the whole society was moving in that direction, not just one person. Wall-E and Eve are the heart of this movie but the humans are used to add some intellectual gravity for the audience to chew on.

Other choices made in the movie might also leave room for debate, such as the integration of some live-action footage into the film. But because the movie as a whole is so audaciously stimulating and brilliantly satisfying, it's a plus that they left us with a few unresolved or unusual things to think about and question after getting off of the great emotional and visual roller-coaster experience. Wall-E truly serves up everything that I think an audience could want in a movie experience. It will be very easy for me to watch this one over and over again. It is a modern-day classic that I believe should earn a place in cinema history as the ""2001"" of CGI animated films, both of them movies of indisputable brilliance, unyielding imagination and unending entertainment.

Here's an ironic hint: it was sung by a guy who threw a grand piano off the stage because he didn't like the light show.

While Billy Corgan isn't quite as outwardly pianocidal, the overriding feeling throughout this behind-the-scenes tour journal is that Billy Corgan is extremely dissatisfied. You wouldn't think he has any right to be, with at least a dozen sellout shows full of rapturous fans, but somehow you get the vibe that he's not getting his rocks off.

""If All Goes Wrong"" is a somewhat disenchanting documentary about the Pumpkins' 2007 mini tour which, rather than zipping all over the globe, planted itself in 2 locations: Asheville, NC and San Francisco, CA. The first thing that all Smashing Pumpkins fans should know is that none of their big hits are played. Correction, Billy sarcastically strums a few chords of (I think it was) ""Today"" with a painful grimace on his face in a hotel room before explaining that he doesn't want to associate with past members in any way.

So what songs do they play? You're going to think I'm kidding but this is true. The bulk of the songs performed on this documentary were stream-of-consciousness diddies which Corgan wrote and hastily arranged for performance in front of an audience the very next day. At first it seemed impressive that he could pull it together like that, but after 6 or 7 repeats of the same formula (no exaggeration!) you get the feeling that Corgan is a lost soul. While the songs aren't quite as bad as ""Chopping Broccoli"" (look it up on Youtube if you haven't heard that masterpiece!), they are certainly unfinished, nothing like the meticulous arrangements and well-produced songs that filled the ""Siamese Dream"" years.

Another major downer (don't worry, the good stuff is coming after) is that the band which Corgan had assembled for this tour are little more than hired guns. Corgan himself says this during one notable incident after a SF show when he lambasts his guitarist for acting like he's ""in the band"" when actually he's just an employee. Don't miss that scene toward the end as it really drives the point home. Other ""employer review"" moments include Corgan accusing his female bassist of boffing some guy outside his (Corgan's) hotel door while he was trying to sleep after the show. All this put together hammers the point home: The Smashing Pumpkins are not a band, this is not ""sex drugs rock & roll"", and nobody is really having a good time.

OK, I promised you some good stuff, right? I actually enjoyed this documentary very much. It showed a side of the stereotypical jaded rockstar in a way we rarely see, warts and all. But unlike your standard rock'n'roll washup story about a rocker who can't reclaim his lost glory, this is a very different tragedy. The fans still love him, but Corgan is his own worst enemy, self destructive to the point that he insists on playing his 45-minute prog rock experiment which the band is clearly not prepared for, and the result is something like Spinal Tap's ""Jazz Odyssey"". All the same, I was enthralled at Corgan's total departure from sensibility. Yes, he could have played crowd pleasers, had a great time and made the fans happy. But no, instead he settled on the artistic merits of publicly self destructing (at one point ending a song with a bitter F U directed at the audience). And, no sarcasm here, I am intrigued by any visionary mind that would go so far to sabotage himself.

Billy Corgan is a true wonder, I say with admiration. He comes across as a jerk, and yet if you go to his website you'll see many of his posts are about stray dogs & cats he's trying to get adopted. The songs played on this documentary were not particularly dazzling, but there were some absolute gems of lyrical wisdom if you listen to the words. Maybe you'll be as intrigued as I was when you watch this. Billy Corgan is not the kind of person I'd ever invite over to dinner (especially because he'd probably sock me in the gums after reading this review), but you can't deny he is an absolute original, a rebel against himself, and when you strip away all the loud guitars and screaming fans, isn't that what rock'n'roll is all about?",

We had a lot of post-movie discussion in our group after this movie, which I think is an objective of documentaries - so the film's director absolutely succeeded in this respect.

There are commentaries throughout from some local DC figures on the importance of the band. I thought it distracted from the film a bit.

For years, I have always been curious about Indian cinema. I've seen clips of Indian films on cable TV and to be honest...I just don't get it. I don't get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But don't get me wrong, Philippine movies back in the 80's were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into movie-making based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines. 

When a friend of mine recommended this movie, I haven't really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasn't. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny, so out of curiosity, I got hold of a copy. 

My first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing ""All iz well.."" I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.

But as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thought-provoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I can't believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated. I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it.",2H50M

The stunning slow-motions and the even more impressive time-lapse sequences of flowering plants and growing mushrooms together with the camera turning around the objects, has now been brought to sheer perfection. Also the sound effects fit really well to what is happening on the screen, sometimes suspenseful sometimes funny. Never before a documentary of central European mixed forests has revealed more of the magic that lies within it, than this one right here. It is on par with BBC and would even fit the big screen. Aside from the technical perspective there are also really interesting stories unfolded that I - as a avid nature doc viewer - have never seen before like the bumblebee that dispelled the brown vole out of it's little den to establish a colony, or the strategy of the arum to take little flies as hostages in order to pollinate them and subsequently harshen the inner surface to enable them to set free again and to pollinate other arums in turn.

Probably the most spectacular images are from the lightnings at night that emblaze the steamy dark forests and the circulations of the stars over the treetops in time lapse.

All in all this is probably one of the best nature documentaries that has not been created by BBC, aside from ""wild Russia"" which is also very recommendable.

On the next year, they meet the singer Gilberto Gil in the beginning of the Tropicalismo, a Brazilian art movement with the fusion of several Brazilian musical genres and rock and roll. They become successful and influential, and sooner, Arnaldo Baptista and Rita Lee get married to each other.

In a perfect world, Os Mutantes would have become one of the greatest bands of the planet. Unfortunately, in 1972, the trio lives in communities and abuses of drugs, mainly LSD, and shifts to the direction of the progressive rock. Rita Lee has problems with her marriage with Arnaldo Baptista and disagreement with the new proposed genre and leaves the band. Then Arnaldo Baptista also leaves the band pursuing the solo career and this is the end of the real Os Mutantes .

In 1982, Arnaldo Baptista is depressed and drugged with LSD, and he is interned in the psychiatric wing of the Hospital do Servidor Público de São Paulo. He tries to commit suicide, jumping off the fourth floor of the hospital but he survives with brain damages.

Arnaldo Baptista is forgotten by the media and lives in Juiz de Fora with his wife Lucinha Barbosa, painting and writing songs. In 2004, he releases the album ""Let it Bed"" and in 2006, he is invited to the reunion of the original Os Mutantes in London, with Zelian Duncan as the lead singer since Rita Lee refused to participate in the show. 

""Loki – Arnaldo Baptista"" is a magnificent documentary produced by Canal Brasil, nostalgic for fans of my generation, and a great indirect message against drugs. It is wonderful to see Arnaldo Baptista happy and singing again despite his limitations.

My only remark is relative to the comments about the behavior of Rita Lee and the real motives that had forced her to end her marriage with Arnaldo Baptista and leave Os Mutantes. Every coin has two sides and the documentary shows only the side of Arnaldo Baptista, who blames her and not the drugs, for all the vicissitudes of his life. My vote is nine.

*** 1/2 (out of 4) 

A rather depressing look at Marcus Dupree, a teenager who was growing up in the small town of Philadelphia, Mississippi who quickly became one of the highest recruited football players in history. After a swarm of recruiters, Dupree finally went to Oklahoma where he had an amazing Freshman year but things took a turn the following year and soon this once untouchable figure had a future that no one was certain about. I'm sure we've all seen countless films or documentaries that discussed great talent that would eventually find the top only to fall and then have to rebuild and make their way to the top again. This film is pretty much different because Dupree was looked at as one of the greatest high school players ever and then his career would pretty much be over in a few years and no one ever really got to see how great he could have been. The fact that Dupree never made it to the top is the main focus of this film and I don't see how anyone could watch this and not feel horrible for the man. There's a bit of redemption where Dupree was finally able to fulfill a dream and that I won't ruin for those unfamiliar with his story. I think director Jon Hock did a very good job at telling us the story and telling it from as many different point of views as possible. We hear from Dupree but we also hear from those who recruited him, friends of his and even from the man who probably stole a lot of money from him. I think the film did a very good job at explaining everything that was going on in this kids life and how he was pretty much thrown away before the age of 24. I'm sure many people will probably remember Dupree but I was way too young to know anything about him and I was certainly too young to see him play. While watching the film it really played out as a mystery how someone with his talent wouldn't eventually find the top of the mountain but I thought Dupree came off very respectable here and you can't help but wonder what he thought about what could have been.",

Of late, when the Indian film industry has mostly been churning one stale product after another with minimal positive quality, Mokashi gives the viewer this Marathi gem. Now this isn't your traditional biopic that starts from birth and ends in death. Nor is it the depressive kind. 'Harishchandrachi Factory' is a movie that is both funny and poignant. It tells how India's first film director made the first Indian movie and this is done with heart and humour.

The film starts off with Phalke skipping his job to work as a magician as he finds his passion in entertaining people. On impulse, he and his son decide to go to the theatre and they watch a short silent film about the 'Passion of Christ'. Phalke is moved by the experience and he keeps returning to the theatre. He decides to make a movie. The man just about makes enough to support his family, but his passion, determination and support of his family, especially his wife, allows him to pursue his destiny.

Mokashi has chosen a unique way of storytelling that has barely been done with biopics. His humour is both satirical, situational, witty and even understated at times. At the same time he does not derail from the focus of the film and its characters. The characters are very real. Phalke may appear larger then life but at the same time he is the common man who lives his life with hope and a little sugar. His wife is far from the caricature wife who nags about her husband's risky attempts. She supports him all the way and does not hesitate to sell off their furniture to make her husband's dream come true. The comedic sequences work excellently. They had me laughing out loud.

Nandu Madhav passionately plays who is today known as the father of Indian cinema. His spirited performance along with Vishawai Deshpande's natural portrayal as Mrs. Phalke are a delight to watch. The supporting cast do a commendable job too.

'Harishchandrachi Factory' is a beautiful little film. The execution is first rate. The cinematography, score, editing and lighting are superb. Mokashi's charming gem is one of a kind and I am sure to revisit this just to feel this film-viewing experience once again.",1H36M

This doc covers the early years with their struggles on the club circuit, getting signed, early tours etc. The things you would expect from a Rock Doc that is covered in other reviews here.

What I liked so much about this were the people. Geddy is interesting and articulate and has that nice ability to tell a story ( a bit like Alice Cooper can.) Alex who is funny and well, pretty normal. And of course the intensely private Neal who has been a Demigod in drumming circles for decades who is intelligent, and surprisingly engaging for a guy with a surly reputation.

In addition to that, you could feel on the screen what great friends these guys were and was especially punctuated towards the end of the film when they were discussing Neils tragedies. To me personally this had two stories, one about a band called Rush and the other story about three great friends overcoming the odds over the years. The other interesting thing is their manager seems to have been with them the whole time which says a lot.

Billy Corgen offered the most celebrity insight, and I found his observations really good. 

I liked some of commentary by Geddy about bands they had toured with like Kiss, they are not the type to put people down because they are superior musicians.

I have never given anything a 10, but this was really good. My wife even liked it and she was not familiar with them at all.

But it's showing signs of recovery and some promise lately. One such entry is Natrang.

Guna (Atul Kulkarni, can't praise enough for his dedication) is an avid Tamasha (folk dance) fan and has talent for writing. After loosing his job he swears to build a troupe but the realizes most important thing they need to find is lead dancer. Pandoba, manager of the troupe played with naturalistic swagger by Kishor Kadam accidentally stumbles upon Naina (Sonali Kulkarni) in Kolhapur (""Lanket Sonyachya Vita""). Pandoba convinces mother (his old flame)-daughter to be partner in the troupe but they want a nachya in their group otherwise threatens to call whole thing off. This sends Guna in real conflict where he has to choose between his social-family-personal image or his dream. He chooses latter in process rises in art industry and falls on personal and social fronts.

Tamasha is famous-infamous in the marathi folklore for various reasons. Making a movie around the secondary character in the show itself is surprising. But he is not mere an actor but a writer (shaahir) of his plays. He plays the part as no one else would and eventually realizes no one else could have. Society often destroys what it doesn't understand. People fail to see he is just a man doing his job. Off-stage he is man he used to be. His on stage image is mistaken with his own sexual orientation. His rebellion is received as an outcast. From society, from family, from his mistress herself who love him all right but in one revealing scene she tells like an actress shelf life of nachya will be short lived. She doesn't want to commit. He is shaken. So are we.

This one is more of biopic of an unusual folk artist but also a very sad one where he has to undergo the ordeal of social banishment, constant humiliation and harrowing acts of cruelty. I was reminded of another film which won Hillary Swank her first Oscar Boys Don't Cry. Writer- director sure deserves the accolades that is been showered on him. Capturing the idyll milieu quite well director moves from laugh to grave subject of its title commendably. Still there were few things where I find it is kind of limited from going for greatness. Like Guna's own personality gets lost in the midst of commercial game where he becomes a pawn or in portraying his relationship with women which is never fully realized. Or film doesn't fully convey the real puzzling situation of fame and infamy he is trapped in.

These are few flaws that bothered me but let me not undermine what this film can mean to Marathi cinema. At one point, Guna decides to come up with what he does best – his own art- as an expression for his salvation. A play around Arjun-Brihaanadda where THE man of all time had to disguise himself as a woman under the circumstances demanded. It's a brilliant idea. And so is the music of the film.

Artist eventually resurrects and refuses to be beaten down and continue to pursue his passion. He succeeds and so does the film.",2H7M

Peter Kay, Michael McIntyre and the like have gotten rich off of it and fair play to them. The television schedules is also significantly fuller of comedy panel shows than it once was – thanks to the success of them as they come over from Radio 4. Coincidentally I had just been listening to Danny Baker and Bill Bailey discussing the very topic a few days before I watched this show. Certainly now there is a trend for the quick one liner and for every single thing that happens to be subject to a quip and young comedians nudge each other off the spotlight.

Stewart Lee may be many things but he isn't that sort of comedian; he is known for not doing ""jokes"" per se and at times his material can be much more acerbic to the point where you're not sure if you can laugh or not. He opens this show with a bit of real life observation about buying a cup of coffee but it spectacularly fails as the smoke machine lets him down, the audience don't feed him the lines he needs and his real life story is not actually that interesting. It is a brilliantly awkward opening to the show and it is no surprise that he moves from there to cleverly dig at those that do those very types of shows and sell millions of DVD's to fans queueing to buy them like ""captured Partisans digging their own mass grave"". He does his own style here and he goes after those that he perceives has sold out for money, whether it be advertising, other comedians and particularly those presenters on Top Gear.

It is brutal stuff and it almost feels like he is intent on alienating his audience by just how angry and clever he is with it. His attack on the non-PC Top Gear and their ""just a joke"" approach is incredible and his assault on Richard Hammond is hilarious and uncomfortable – particularly a story from his childhood (the two went to the same school) that is moving, involving, reveals a lot about Hammond's cowardice and is of course entirely fictional. While many comedians make fun of adverts, Lee does it here by constructing an entire world of history about language and tradition simply so he can exaggerate his rage. This sends him into the audience in a simulated breakdown during which he attacks specific members of the audience for piracy, for moving around during his bit and so on. It is brutally entertaining.

Lee is not to everyone's tastes and there are times when I'm not even sure if he is to mine or not; however this is a really great show. Inventive, cleverly structured and masterfully delivered. It feels like it is collapsing and that his audience will all walk out any second but yet that is all part of the construct – it really shouldn't work but it is very effective, very engaging and very funny.

This documentary is not actually a documentary, but is a story about how stories take on lives of their own and infect the imaginations of many human beings, especially those whose influence on the world makes the infections all the more dangerous.

Flitting from idea to idea, Curtis weaves a narrative by linking somewhat disparate topics and attempts to convince us, the viewers, that his story is true. The world has been manipulated by an elite via computer networks. The idea of a balance in nature contributes to our misguided attempts at understanding nature. We become machines ourselves in the subjugation and erroneous divisions of colonized territories. But ah, these are just stories.

Be careful of stories and ideas, Curtis warns, for they have a habit of dictating reality. In presenting us a somewhat plausible explanation of various events in recent history, he presents a story that may or may not be wholly factual, but satisfies that conspiracy theorist lurking underneath us all. The possibility of us accepting a ""story"" for ""fact"" is perhaps the essential point of this documentary. So when viewing All Watched Over, be mindful of that you are watching is simply a narrative about how narratives, if taken too religiously, could have terrible consequences.",

It doesn't leave you frustrated or confused. You can't really complain that it didn't explore certain ideas or follow through. By deciding to have an official ending to this trilogy's story, the themes surrounding Batman are very fresh. We don't know where he'll end up. It's not the same old thing about whether he can continue to be Batman or not, which was already getting repetitive in Spider-man 2. The conclusions are not as important as the feelings they invoke as they come about. Nolan is especially good at capturing the complete tension of actually not knowing what will happen and deeply questioning what you *want* to happen and why.

This movie is bigger than the previous two, far more ambitious. There are no obvious annoying weaknesses that usually come with films in general, especially blockbuster action movies. All of Nolan's movies have deep psychological themes and this takes those in another new direction. I thought Inception was hugely original and insightful about the way people think. That level of abstraction and depth is present in this film. Bane bursts into it, his reputation is quickly established. Nolan uses people's expectations and anticipation to the fullest. We are left to wonder about what has happened in the 8 years since the events of The Dark Knight. Why have the characters become the way they are now?

In the latter half, it does seem like the movie is trying to pull off so many different plot points and connections, but they all work. The cast is very large and impressive. You don't see ""good acting"". You see fascinating characters. They're just playing their part in the grand story that's being crafted. There are many unfamiliar faces but they all have a strange, unique look to them. We often see a person's flaws and previous decisions coming back to haunt them. They find out the hard way what mistakes they have made. Where their limits are. Where they lose control.

The score is almost tribal, very raw and energetic. You don't get much chance to pay attention to it but many parts of the movie are pounding with excitement. There are countless quotable lines and disturbing slices of dialogue. They cut deep. The Joker was a great character and this is a very different movie but the themes are just as dark, only perhaps indirectly. Underneath, it's very sinister. Writing and efficiency appear to be among Nolan's greatest strengths. The story has many layers that interweave and apparently they came in under budget.

Perhaps the most important thing about Catwoman is that she's completely believable. When she beats up men, you don't roll your eyes. She's feminine and powerful in her own way. She fits into the world and we completely understand her motivations. She doesn't have a huge role but a very important one.

I didn't find myself moved but maybe I'm too cynical. I was more affected psychologically. Curious about humanity and all the different sides of it you see in this movie. It goes to many extremes. I felt humbled by my complete lack of life experience. What do I know about anything? How could I possibly understand half of the characters? I haven't been through anything or achieved anything compared to most of them. Michael Caine gets a bigger role this time. He was always critical but this time he's very much the emotional core.

I thought Christian Bale was overlooked in The Dark Knight especially. The movies hinge on him. Bruce Wayne's just a man but also incredibly inspirational. Bale's famous for completely committing to his roles and it pays off. Tom Hardy is impressive as Bane but I suppose that's no surprise. The rest of the leads are similarly awesome. There are many references to the earlier films. Very few questions are left unanswered. It's always nice when film-makers really think it through and make an actual decision and get all the details right.

So anyway, I'll miss Batman (since the trilogy has ended) but couldn't have hoped for a better, more epic and sincere finale to his story.",2H44M

Django Unchained is superb from start to finish, it's a 2 hour and 45 minute movie yet you're on the edge of your seat, eyes glued to the screen for the whole ride. It's the closest thing to a flawless movie I have ever seen. Before I continue my praise of this movie, let me say this ""the movie is not for everyone."" Clearly its rated R and it has several gruesome violent scenes, it also contains vulgar language and numerous uses of the ""n"" word. Some may claim it's excessive, but I personally appreciate how realistic it portrays the horror and tragedy of slavery. That being said, I am torn if I am more impressed with Tarantino as a writer of this movie or its director. He simply is a cinematic genius. The casting of this movie alone deserves an Oscar. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo DiCaprio all put on Oscar worthy performances, and frankly, I would be astonished if they all did not win. I truly can't picture any actor on this planet being able to play any of those three roles as magnificently as these three actors did. I sum this movie into three general thirds, First: where Waltz steals the show, Second: where DiCaprio steals the show, and Third: where Foxx steals the show. I have only seen Waltz in ""Inglorious Bastards"" other than ""Django Unchained"" and he is rapidly climbing my favorite actors list. Leo is my personal favorite actor ever since his performance in ""The Departed"" and it was incredible to see him take on the challenging role as his first villain, Calvin Candie, possibly the most evil character I've ever seen in a film. Finally Jamie Foxx from start to finish played his best performance in any movie to date. Simply phenomenal. I loved how the audience sees his character evolve from a powerless slave to a confident powerful man. In addition to these three remarkable performances, Kerry Washington and Samuel L. Jackson also deliver. Washington goes through living hell yet remains a strong woman throughout. Jackson plays a very interesting role as Stephen, Leo's loyal house slave. Trust me, you will hate him yet at the same time he is hilarious. Now's a good time to mention, this movie is funny! Tarantino perfectly tosses in frequent bursts of pure laughter throughout the movie to lighten up from the serious aspects of the movie. There is one scene in particular, involving Jonah Hill and Don Johnson, which had the crowd roaring in laughter for a solid full minute. Which brings me to my next point, the cast is absurd! The rather small roles for such big actors such as Jonah Hill and Don Johnson, just shows how honored actors are taking any role no matter how small for a Quentin Tarantino film. I recognized famous actors and actresses throughout the entire movie. There is one brief scene, where I believe I even saw famous rapper ""Childish Gambino"" for literally just a few seconds as a slave in Mississippi. This movie was done perfectly to a tee; even the remarkable soundtrack caught my attention, nicely combining songs of the past with modern day songs. This movie is a western, a drama, a tragedy, a comedy, an action, a thriller, and at it's deepest roots a romance. If you haven't already, stop what you're doing and see this movie today. Whatever you're doing can wait but this movie can't. Just make sure your 17, have your license, and have a stomach for more of the most gruesome violence I have yet to see on a screen. In conclusion, I've heard rumors of Tarantino pondering the idea of retiring as a director and Oo what a sad day that would be for movie lovers like myself, but if they are true at least he's going out with one hell of a BANG!",2H45M

And even if arguably flawed on a film-making level, this is powerful, sometimes gut wrenching stuff. You know a documentary has a real effect when immediately after watching you feel compelled to send money to two charities you've never heard of before. 

It does a great job of never downplaying the horrors of the subjects it tackles; sex trafficking of under-aged girls, denial of education, genital mutilation, etc., while managing to always leave room for hope. In each case, we see a brave, almost saintly woman or organization fighting the odds and personal danger to change things. So instead of feeling depressed you feel agitated and energized. ""These situations are awful, but no situation is beyond hope and change"" is the constant theme. 

The elements that bothered me certainly didn't undercut the power of the film's message, but did make watching it less emotional than it might have been. The device of having female celebrities be our surrogate guide into each of these situations seemed odd and smacked of pandering. I found myself frustrated listening to the feelings of the actresses about what they were seeing, and would gladly have traded that time for more interviews with experts in the fields, or the actual victims and those who are working for change. The idea we needed to see this through movie and TV stars eyes (as intelligent and well-intentioned as these women are) seems to really underestimate the intelligence of the audience. 

I also found the sameness of style made the pieces start to lose some power as they went along. Or perhaps it was the choice of the ordering of the 6 stories. But after crying at the first three stories, I found myself less moved by the last three. Perhaps it was simple emotional overload. 

Last, I had mixed feelings that all the stories where from 3rd world countries (with the exception of India). It is true that the most gross and glaring abuses of women are taking place in these poor, developing nations, but it would have been very powerful to see how even in 1st world counties women are facing the same battles (do we really think there's no sex-slavery or forced under-aged prostitution in the US? That girl babies aren't aborted in China?). By telling only stories of far off worlds so mired in poverty, a chance was lost to make the point that miss-treatment and abuse of women transcends national boundaries, class, or how 'advanced' the nations are. 

But those complaints noted, this is strong and important stuff. It should be seen by all means, and get ready to have your heart hurt, and maybe even to take action.",3H44M

It's broadcasted as Jordan turns fifty (not points, but years) and indeed his NBA titles, Olympics game medal (as well as the European Championship of my hometown) are twenty years behind. What have we become since? A lot of my dreams turns into nightmare (democracy, job, society) and it was premonition to call this team, a Dream, because watching it brought me tears...

As my hometown is the ultimate French team for basketball (not Pau, the other!), i grew up watching basketball, playing basketball. The NBA came in my life in 1991 with Canal + and two new magazines, ""Mondial Basket"" and ""5 majeur"", whose first cover was already the Dream team! My first impression was to stick with Jordan, Pippen and Jackson and what a ride they gave me up to 2010! 

Summer 1992 was maybe the best ever: having graduated from high-school with honors, it was just a basketball extravaganza all summer before starting university. I remember the Portland tournament and the Barcelona games that I taped on VHS. My favorite game was USA-Germany with an outstanding game from Larry!

Regarding the documentary, it's a good work: the frenzy about the team and its inner dynamics are there. It's due to the fact that it's footage but also interviews with all the teamers and beyond (the commissioner, Kukoc). The coaches are a bit left and the most astounding fact is forgotten: Coach Daly never calls a single time-out in any games, even when the team was losing against Croatia in the finale. But it's an honest account as nothing is kept under the carpet (the card games, the logo controversy)...

What's is amazing is to see that all the team-up are true competitors, hard workers, courageous, polite and joyful people. It's such a change from our whining, insulting, fast tired French soccer proclaimed champions! So, they are the dream team because they have class, no more no less. The later teams aren't dream anymore (they even lose) but Coach K's tenure writes an incredible chapter (actually, 52v –1l!). 

Writing all this, i can just cry because basketball moments like this were indeed unique: they have come and now they are gone, except in our memories!",1H8M

But the way C.K. utilizes a metaphor or simile is artful in how he can conjoin two separate ideas together, where he can wormhole the audience's minds to some unexpected grotesque places for comparisons. And then he builds on it by acting out these ridiculous thought trains. There was also one improvisational moment where he accidentally spills water and he comments on it that had me aching in laughter. The bit he did as his closer was truly the climax of this new hour.

C.K. makes a point that being older makes a more intelligent and interesting person. He is the living embodiment of his own point. We're watching a comedian who has grown into himself, and we're intrigued not just for the laughs, but because he has something to say. A voice with true gravitas that he has earned from living a life.

And for that, Louis C.K. seems eternally connected to the grotesque and the morbid, but it's all enwrapped over a positive message: appreciate life and what you have. That's how he gets away with saying very horrible things on stage. As an audience member, I rather enjoy watching him get away with it.

From the telling, Crystal had a remarkable childhood, and came from a remarkable family. His father owned a music store and promoted concerts, and knew and was loved by many of jazz's all time greats. His family come off as sweet if eccentric. As related here, this was a family without many of the painful skeletons in their closets that most of us grew up with. It's sort of the Jewish version of Norman Rockwell's America, but I don't mean that as a put down. Crystal seems to truly appreciate the blessings he's had, and to honor and love the people who made him who he is. He doesn't deny that life can be painful, but that doesn't mean for a second he's going to say it's not wonderful and worthwhile. 

If a few moments of emotion feel forced in the unforgiving close up lens of a camera, there's a lot that ring true, no matter that Crystal has performed variations of this monologue on stage hundreds of times.",

Shot (or post-processed) monochromatic. And it sometimes reminds me of Kubrick; It's not hard to find a frame where that b/w looks beautiful; good balance and a somewhat ""stark"" look (low ambient light) that lends Burr an iconic look--particularly when he makes a face... which he does quite a bit in this show.

If you don't like cussing, skip it. Funny thing I've reflected upon wrt to Burr (and Oswalt, and...): Seinfeld often says that cussing in stand-up comedy is a shortcut; by which he means (sort of) cheating; hedging your bets with material short on genuine laughs by appealing to folks' prurience.

Well, Burr, et.al., put the lie to that. If there's anywhere that Burr cheats, it's in his way of morally shooting from the hip. But that doesn't daunt me: Even when I disagree with his moral calculus, I'm sincerely thankful for his shining, genuine humor, which is the stuff that *truly* covers a Multitude of Sins (as we all know, IFF we've kept *our* senses of humor!).

So this cussing hasn't stopped Seinfeld from hosting this ilk on his Cars/Coffee show... and is it a purely marketing decision (keeping ""hep"" with ""the youth"")? I think not!

I would be remiss not to point out that Burr has a very finely tuned comic instrument, which complements his comedic sensibility perfectly.

They make movies for the domestic market only, just like the largest mango producer in the world and consumes it all with a 1% export rate. Even small countries that have no big market like India competes with the European standards. But in the recent times the changes have been seen, lots of parallel cinemas are made; is what called alternate to the masala films (mixed genres). The young generation supporting it, both from the audience and the filmmaker.

The sad thing is they're choosing a wrong movie to represent the country in the Oscars, so as a result ending up with a disappointment every time. I thought last year they failed to pick 'The Lunchbox' as similar to this one for this year. I don't know whether they would have won the trophy, but these films need to be recognised in a big stage like that. Making into the final five reveals all the India films are not random musical beats. So my point is India missed the bus to the venue Dolby Theatre Hollywood, LA, USA for the second consecutive time.

This film feels like a feather fallen out of the British film 'Slumdog Millionaire', but it was totally a different genre except sets in and about the slum kids. A simple story, yet very moving. Two young brothers go regularly to pick the crow's egg in an vacant site near their slum since they can't offer chicken eggs. When the place is bought by a largest pizza chain in the city to bring up their new branch, the kids fix their mind to taste their first pizza and put all the effort to make it happen. But again, they have to face all the odds and that's where the narration takes the turn before heading the end.

""I want pizza too, not dad.""

Without the prior experience the two kids were so awesome in their performances. They two won the best child actor award at the Indian Academy Awards, including the film as the best children's movie of the year. The debutant director really did a great job, especially knowing there's no mass market for newcomers. I think the producers, Dhanush and Vetrimaran to appreciate for this movie to happen. No doubt why it did better at foreign markets than the local. Especially Kollywood does good in the East and Southeast Asia, unlike Bollywood that dominates Europe and North America.

You know why this little film is a must see, because Indian films are known for different standards to the rest of the world, but when they make one out of their comfort that puts automatically a must watch. That's not the only reason, there are hundreds of themes yet to explore in Indian cinema and this is one of that. Like the two cute movie characters and their one innocent task, the scenes and music were well supported throughout.

Some of the domestic issues that India is suffering from long back like the social status brought into the light with this. There's no equal respect in society for all the communities, only it is judged by their lifestyle. Most of the third world's social backward is only for this reason and obviously the lack of basic education. So it is really good when a movie is not only identified for its entertainment, but the message it carried out. It is an adorable, smart, funny, emotional, enjoyable family movie and one of the best of 2015 other than the Hollywood's or English language films. In the world cinema fanatic circuit, Indian films is the least followed, but this one is not to be missed.

Once again, this film stands as a testament, particularly in witnessing that this same film is being remade in several Indian languages, showcasing the talents of several lead actors, since its conception as the Malayalam film; Drishyam, with Mohanlal.

I've heard many people say that they are partial to the original malayalam version - perhaps because they saw it first? But there is another side to this story. A filmmaker rarely gets the chance to do the same film twice, and if he is still as passionate about the story the second or third time, each time he makes it, he perfects the telling just a little more... I often hear stories about writers/directors lamenting about how they would look back at their work and notice mistakes they made that they would love to do-over had they been given the chance.

With Papanasam, what I see is the director, Jeethu Joseph, having improved upon himself. Of all the versions of the film I have seen, the tamil film comes across by far the most subtle - and that is in particular due to Kamal Haasan's sensibilities and energy permeating and influencing the cast, I feel.

So, personally, yes, the tamil version is the best! I understand that people who are sentimental towards 'originals' might not agree, but I think if you were willing to be impartial and unbiased, it is difficult to miss the perfection of this film in the tamil version.

And I was THRILLED! Not only the album but its visuals also succeeded at entertaining me. Unlike her last album which had individual visuals for each track, Lemonade's visuals are connected with mysterious and meaningful poetry that has given me chills. This lengthy but entertaining music video/visual album shows us Beyoncé's doubts about Jay-Z. It opens with ""Intuition"" where Beyoncé starts to question their relationship and followed by ""Denial"" where Beyoncé tries to be ""less awake"". In ""Anger"", Beyoncé tells Jay-Z ""if he tries this s*** again, he go lose his wife"" while in ""Reformation"", Beyoncé tries to repair their relationship. Eventually, it finishes with ""Redemption"" where Beyoncé understands that Jay is her true love and she cannot leave him. Its trailer makes it look dark and creepy, but trust me, IT IS NOT. And you are hearing this from a person who isn't a Beyoncé fan(Well, not anymore :)) And now, Lemonade is one of my favourite albums, while Beyoncé is one of my favourite artists.",

Miguel loves music and must keep his love a secret from his family who has forbidden music of any kind since the days of his great great grandmother. On Día de Muertos, Miguel wants to enter a contest to showcase his musical talent, but his grandmother intervenes, reiterating the family's ban on music. 

In his hunt for a suitable guitar to play, Miguel finds himself in the land of dead, meeting the spirits of those who have passed on. On his adventure he meets his musical hero, much of his deceased family, and a strange man who asks for his help and quickly becomes a close friend. Along the way, Miguel helps his new friend and his friend helps him understand the true significance of Día de Muertos. 

Of course, the title character (Coco) turns out to play a vital role before the movie is over. When the moment arrives, she delivers something powerful, and it's beautiful. It moved me in a very satisfying way that felt well-earned and authentic, rather than manipulative, the way many movie moments of this sort feel. 

Quick sidebar: when I took Spanish in high school, my teachers would occasionally incorporate culture from Spanish-speaking countries (usually Mexico) into the lessons. In some of these lessons, I learned about Día de Muertos. Sort of. I'm not sure if the lessons were lacking or if I just wasn't paying much attention to them. Regardless, I learned more about Día de Muertos from Coco than I did in four years of high school Spanish classes. 

In high school, my understanding of Día de Muertos was that it was basically a Mexican Halloween. They raised spirits from the dead and played music or something, as I understood it. It seemed silly to me. After watching Coco I realized that the tradition is anything but silly. 

It's not about the dressing up or the food or the music. It's about family and remembering those that came before us. Leave it to Pixar to not only entertain me, but also educate me about a rich and wonderful tradition of another culture. Bravo!",1H45M

What A Disaster Movie.

Endgame is the highest grossing film ever worldwide and the 5th highest worldwide when adjusted for inflation. But it was complete Garbage. It is not part of the 23 MOVIES anymore.

After a year of waiting since that Epic Piece that was Infinity War, this is the Endgame that Dr. Strange was on about? What A Disaster, It was a complete shambles. They had perfect vision when they made Infinity War but it is like they lost the Power when making this silly borefest.

Problems with this movie:

° Where was The Living Tribunal? The Being was ment to Bring the Characters Back and Judge Thanos. Not this Time Travel Garbage.

° What happened to Captain Marvel? A whole origin movie for her, for the build up to this and that's what they produce? Is this a Joke?

° How can you destroy the Infinity Stones when each of them contain an Element of Existence itself?

° How Can You Put the Soul Stone back?

° How can Gamora come back from the dead but Black Widow Can't?

° Why is Hulk a Big Joke? Isn't he the Strongest?

° This Thanos doesn't know any of the people he is fighting.

° The Time Travel fix everything nonsense, do they not get it? It is just too easy and boring.

° The movie is way too long and boring.

° Thor was a complete Joke

° No Epic Battle between Hulk and Thanos that EVERYONE was waiting for.

° No Proper battle between Captain Marvel and Thanos that was built up to happen.

° The Final battle was Lacklustre

The Highlights were:

° Great Quotes from Thanos

° Captains America vs Thanos was Great

° The 'I Am Inevitable' Snap from Thanos was Really Great

This Movie was terrible, what the hell were they thinking?

The Endgame should have started out by Thanos Seeking to Make another Infinity Gauntlet for the purpose of defence, then using the Reality and Time Stones to recover his army. Begin Fortifying his Defenses on a different Planet with his army defending him and getting ready for the Avengers final assault on him now that they have recruited Captain Marvel.

The Living Tribunal Should of Judged Thanos and Brought the Characters back in this Movie.

The Tramp cares for an abandoned child, but events put that relationship in jeopardy.",1921-02-06,"baby,boy,orphan,social worker,abandoned baby",8.3,Quinoa1984,2008-08-21,"It's easy to call Charlie Chaplin a genius, but I'll say it once again: the man was a genius, if only at doing a certain particular kind of film. You wouldn't ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film, or at least one like out of Germany, or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths. His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the 20s and 30s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion. Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental, but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and (the usual kicked-around word) manipulated amid the comedic set-ups. Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer, and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the Kid.

As it stands even at 50 minutes, which was trimmed by Chaplin himself 50 years after its original release and including a new musical score, it's just about a perfectly told tale. It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that 'Dreamland' sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful light-and-dark examination of all the major characters in the picture- now with angel wings and devil horns! What it's about, in complete basics, is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she won't be able to take care of him, and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at, and the Tramp decides to take care of him (he even names him, in one amusing aside, John). Then it cuts to 5 years later, and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows, eat lots of pancake, and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an ""Older Brother"" of a kid John gets in a fight with. Meanwhile, the mother is now a success, not knowing her child is somewhere- right in front of her nose.

This may sound like a bit of story, but it's told briskly and without a missed beat in editing, and Chaplin's re-edit tightens it to a point where we're mostly with the Kid and the Tramp. Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be: playful, absurd, cute, and bittersweet to a degree. We know this can't exactly last, but the moment the poor maybe-sick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic (and yet partially triumphant) sequences in the movies. It's in a case like this, where we as the audience tear up, more or less, as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out, and then inter-cut with Chaplin's daring dash across the roof-tops to save him, that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other. This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film, silent or otherwise; that it's silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true: even a beat with the Kid playing with toys, an obviously ""cute"" bit, is great, and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like Chaplin.

Featuring some excellent set-pieces just unto themselves (aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that belly-laugh part with the repetitive brick-hit to the head, or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin), an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin, and excellent performances from all supporting cast (including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance), it's altogether an awe-inspiring feat. To see this or City Lights or Modern Times to an extent is to see ideas and character outlasting far beyond their time and place as something far more valuable to the public consciousness.",1H8M

For a film like this to be made in 1931 is just shocking. Even if the film was released today it would still be nothing like we have seen before. In our modern age of film making there has been a considerable rise in the production of films about serial killers, their complexities and particularly about pathological ones. Yet, M is the first movie that comes to my mind when I think of the themes that have been in Psycho, Silence of the Lambs, Seven and not to mention countless more.

The film is lead by Peter Lorre in a transcending performance who plays the serial killer and rapist in which the film is centered around. In this performance Lorre is successful in something that at the very least is rare to see in any kind of film, compassion for a child killer and rapist. Lorre makes the viewer see, that he is not a criminal by choice but by a sickness of compulsion. Too often then not is our perception of a psychotic killer having that look that puts fear into his or hers victims' eyes. Lorre doesn't do that but rather displays a frightened man, a scared man. One in which his desperation leads to his hazardous behavior. His portrayal of a killer is not of a fearless one but of one consumed by fear. Something that even today we as a people cannot understand, let alone in 1931.

The direction and writing of Fritz Lang is beyond comprehensible as he taps into the mind of a serial killer and his complexities. He does so in such that we get an empathetic and compassionate illustration of all sides of the story. This in which by then end of the film all points of view are more then well delivered to the audience. Fritz Lang here, has simply created here a timeless masterpiece. One that excels in its technical aspects and enlightens the audience on a topic that other films still have not yet to match M in.

I highly recommend this film for many obvious reasons and conclusions. This film was created by one of the all time great directors in Fritz Lang, Lang's command for the screen is mesmerizing and a joy to witness and so on and so forth. Yet much of this is mostly superficial and a waste of time to continuously state. M, as I mentioned before takes a strong and original stance on an issue that we as a society yet have not fully resolved. This film may not give you THE answer on this issue but it may sway that moral compass of yours that lies inside of all of us.",1H39M

There are simply 3 reasons the film, which was considered as the ""Mona Lisa of all films"" , created such a legendary appeal upon release in 1941: 1) This was Orson Welles first cinematic debut , even though he had been a huge star in theater , he was given an opportunity few first time directors were permitted to having. He had full artistic freedom and above all power, to direct , produce, write and even star in his own picture. Therefore the film industry and RKO pictures had absolutely no influence in the making of the film and were not to know what was happening on set .Of course this was bound to generate a number of problems as businessmen were curious about the nature and plot of the film , which takes us to the second reason the film caused controversy.

2)One of the main reasons the film posed contentions was because the main character , Charles Foster Kane(Orson Welles), featured a range of similarities with real media mogul and newspaper journalist William Randolph Hurst . Therefore the film was seen as depicting the life , problems and personal relationships of a real person thus fictionalizing his life. Some of the similarities between the two persona's are:

KANE: newspaper tycoon , worked for New York Inquirer , known as the Kubla Khan of Xanadu ,married talentless singer Susan Alexander Kane, he was a political aspirant to presidency by campaigning for governor, bought his wife the Municipal Opera House, Financier Thatcher, and threat Getty's. Hurst: yellow journalist , worked for New York Journal, political aspirant to presidency by becoming governor, married acress Marion Davies, bought his wife Cosmopolitan Pictures, financier JP Morgan , and threat Tammany Hall.

-differences: Susan Alexander Kane( Dorothy Comingdore) leaves Kane later in their life however there was no marriage breakdown for Hurst and Marion.

3) The last reason and most pivotal of all to why the film was regarded the way it was , was due to its technical and stylistic innovations . The film upon its release was misunderstood and unappreciated by critics as they couldn't comprehend many of its elements and were too concerned with its dark and mysterious nature which is one of Welles's characteristics in his films. The film after all was 20 years ahead of its time and was only regarded as a triumphant success upon its second release after the American Film Noir era in the 1950's. His most prominent artistic inventions were: -the low angled camera movements -extreme facial closeups -long uninterrupted shots -chiaroscuro lighting -overlapping dialogue , giving a realistic effect to conversations -subjective camera angles -deep focus shots and depth of field -flashbacks that make up most of the film All the above and more constitute to why the film is so influential to all would be film directors and for why many people regard it as the best film of all time. Lastly we musnt forget the exceptional score by Bernard Herrmann who had collaborated also with the best known director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock , and made him the chillin sounds of strings in Psycho and Vertigo to name a few . In addition the superb photography of Gregg Toland in regards to Welles's unique eye on details. After all he wanted to put in each shot everything the human eye can see if they were present.

There are many areas of the film which are crucial , these are some of the most important , and as you can see there is never too little or too much that you can add to this masterpiece .",1H59M

One man named Ricci who haunts the job lines day after day to provide for his wife and two children, when suddenly his name is called for a well-paying city job.  The only catch is that he needs a bicycle for the job, and he has just pawned his bicycle in order to feed his family.  Thus begins `The Bicycle Thief', Vittorio de Sica's gritty study in realism.  Ricci and his wife sell the sheets off of their beds to get the bicycle back, only to have the bicycle stolen on his first day on the job. In order to keep the job, he and his young son walk around Rome, desperate to find the thief, and more importantly, the bicycle before his next day of work.  

de Sica chose non-actors to portray the characters in the film, favoring a further realistic vision by casting amateurs.  The result is remarkable, because the pain and emotions conveyed are so true.  The relationship between father and son is also compelling and endearing, in that for the most part, Ricci treats his son as an equal, letting him in on his innermost thoughts and fears, until the end, when a particular event causes him to be ashamed, and the roles become defined once again.  

`The Bicycle Thief' personifies the refreshing fact that European cinema was more daring and also true in their reaction to post-war life.  While America was trying to paint a heavy coat of rosy paint on the times by churning out the saccharine MGM musicals by the dozen, Europe was showing that the effects of a war fought on their home turf did not inspire moments of spontaneously breaking into song, or a choreographed dance number, rather life pretty much sucked, but survival, as difficult and ugly as it can be, is most important.  `The Bicycle Thief' has been a critical favorite for decades, and for good reason.  It is a must-see film for any cinephile.

I have a particular interest in the nature of faith, and undertook to view Ordet as something ""good for me,"" but probably arduous. Wrong! I also grew up in an area heavily populated by Scandinavians, and knew immigrants who were contemporaries of the oldest characters in the picture.

Ordet, set in 1925, is a dead-on take of old-school Scandinavian culture, suffused with both the most intense dramatic elements imaginable and moments of comic relief as well. The action moves right along without help of special effects or a distracting musical score.

This picture at least alludes to the seldom-asked question, ""Why do people believe?"" Is it merely for the rewards of faithfulness, or something more?

The final scene, utterly devoid of effects or music, has a dramatic power unexcelled in the ensuing 47 years of cinema to date. It is very long, but uses its duration in service of the tension of the story. Nobody is yelling, fighting or firing weapons, despite the fact they are enduring emotional torment that is as painful as it gets.

In an oblique way, the scene reminded me of the part of Jim Jarmusch's ""Down By Law"" where Tom Waits and Co. are sitting in the clink in real time, and time passes glacially in one very long scene, illustrating the sheer boredom of incarcerated life. Here real time is used to illustrate the unrelenting nature of grief. In both cases we see what happens long after the scene would have changed in nearly any other picture. The pace conforms plausibly with real life, and in so doing serves the dramatic tension.

One negative review alludes to the final shot and the expression in a character's eyes. I would defend that as an insight that no blessing is unmixed.

As others have noted, one needn't hold a Christian point of view to enjoy this film and be given much to ponder. See it.",2H6M

The details of the final escape make for one of the most memorable sequences in cinema - interspersed with episodes of doubt in which he falters for hours or more before taking the next step, just as he delays the escape itself for many days even though he knows his execution is imminent. It's almost like a sombre dance with death, or at least a morally exacting examination of one's limits and a fear of the transcendent (which in this case is represented merely by freedom itself). There are no moments of light relief or variation here, just an attention to process and causality - the concentration on the plan almost becomes a means of redemption, until carrying out the plan becomes almost superfluous if not destructive. Of all Bresson's films, this is the one that best engages on a thematic level while simultaneously working as narrative - his distilled gravity constitutes a fantastically effective suspense mechanism; a model of tight storytelling.",1H41M

Part of the success of the movie lies in the screen play by Ernest Lehman, one of the best writers of that era. Also, the haunting music by Mr. Hitchcock's usual collaborator, Bernard Hermann, adds texture to what we are seeing. Together with all the above mentioned qualities, ""North by Northwest"" was photographed by Robert Burks and was edited by George Tomasini, both men did outstanding jobs to enhance a film that shows a mature and inspired Alfred Hitchcock.

The film works because of the witty dialog Mr. Lehman wrote. This has to be one of the riskiest projects undertaken by Mr. Hitchcock because of the sexiness Eva Kendall exudes throughout the film and the repartee between her and Roger Thornhill. The film mixes adventure and romance that aren't put ons, as one feels what one's watching to be really happening.

Much has been said in this forum as to the values of this classic, so we shall only add our pleasure in seeing this masterpiece any time it turns on cable. In fact, the film hasn't dated, the way some others of the same period have. The highlights of the film are the sequences involving the crop duster, the train ride to Chicago where Eve and Roger first meet, the auction, and the Mount Rushmore climax.

This is one of the best contributions by Cary Grant to any of his work with the director. Roger Thornhill is one of the best roles Mr. Grant played, during his long career. His chemistry with Eva Marie Saint is perfect. This young actress added class and elegance to the picture. James Mason and Martin Landau played villains convincingly. Jesse Royce Landis, Leo G. Carroll, and the rest of the supporting cast is excellent.

The Apartment really surprised me. The Best Picture winner starts off right in the middle of the action, but yet the first hour seems long and overrun. Too much time seems spent in trying to develop the characters (and oh so many of them) and not enough time is spent on just seeing what will happen. Just when I was about to lose faith, the film picks it up like I have never seen before. The whole sub-plot of the four guys wanting to use Lemmon's apartment for their evening tyrsts is dropped and Wilder smartly concentrates on Lemmon, MacLaine and MacMurray and the film creates true magic.

The Apartment is more of a drama than a comedy and balances the two elements perfectly. Just after one of the more dramatic moments of the film, we see Lemmon straining his pasta with a tennis racquet. The use of the doctor and his wife in supporting roles are completely there for comedy and yet add so much to the film. The ending also rates up there with the best of all time using an old device that doesn't seem at all cliched in this film. Some say that ""Some like it hot"" was Wilder's best, but now I have to disagree. The Apartment is better and surely would have made my top ten had the first hour not been so predictable.

How Jack Lemmon didn't win Best Actor is beyond me. His is a great performance, getting to act on more than one scale. MacMurray, another Wilder favourite is perfectly cast in the role of a family-wrecker. I wish they would have put a scene in which his wife confronts him with ""The News"". MacLaine glows on the screen even when she is sick and in bed.

I fully recommend this film to all, it being Wilder's best makes it a must see.

This family drama is full of emotional turmoils and tragic upheavals.

The four sons of a poor rural Italian family from the South travel with their mother to join their oldest brother in Milan. Each of the five brothers must adjust to a new life in the big city. Their mother is a strong bond that connects them. However, it is difficult to be a harmonious family in the big city. A beautiful prostitute is a cause of discord in their family...

Every new experience in the lives of these people is a kind of incident. The protagonists are not able to change their lives. The family is what makes life. Life without the family does not make sense. This is a realistic view of a bitter life, which have gradually extinguished. Emotions are not consistent with the nature of some of the protagonists. Therefore, strong outbursts of emotions are a little bit grotesque. Jealousy, devotion to family or an unrequited love are completely normal life situations. In this case, these are incurable life's wounds. Emotionalism and realism are so intertwined that it is impossible to draw a clear line in some key scenes. Therefore, certain events in this film can not be called a life experience, more a tragedy. 

The atmosphere is obscured. It is a reflection of a life in the fog, without a clear future. Some scenes are truly shocking. Their significance is even greater, because, human spirit is excommunicated through these scenes.

Alain Delon as Rocco Parondi is a loyal, generous and naive young man. He carries a burden of deep pain and family responsibilities on his shoulders. A character, who is trying to find the best in people. His performance has certainly captured the hearts of many viewers.

Annie Girardot as Nadia has offered a great performance. A young and beautiful prostitute is torn between two philosophies of life. However, she is not able to choose between a false urban hedonism and true love. Others have chosen for her. It is a tragedy of her character. Renato Salvatori as Simone Parondi is a restless and depressed loafer. A violent man, who can not settle down. The big city is full of good opportunities, but some of them may be a great challenge for an inexperienced young man.

Their support are Katina Paxinou (Rosaria Parondi) as a hysterical and helpless mother, Max Cartier (Ciro Parondi) is a kind of voice of reason, Spiros Focás (Vincenzo Parondi) is a quiet and calm oldest brother and Claudia Cardinale (Ginetta) is his emotional wife.

Here, filmmaker Chris Marker presents the audience with the ultimate cinematic dystopia; a futuristic, industrialised landscape of underground tunnels, colourless streets and jarring 60's architecture. The results are beautiful yet somewhat anachronistic, as the filmmaker employs a similar approach to that of Godard in Alphaville (1965) - or more recently, Winterbottom's Code 46 (2003) - albeit, with a less straightforward attitude to plot and ideology.

The basic narrative outline of the film is built around various reflective layers - similar to what Tarkovsky would use in his later film, Mirror (1975) - which allow Marker to create a certain feeling of mirroring between the notions of fact and fiction, life and death, reality and fantasy and so on. This, in turn, further develops the characters and the world of which they inhabit. The reason the film works without becoming a cold, lifeless lecture is because it anchors the images of nuclear holocaust and scientific exploration within humanistic characters and a sense of unashamed romanticism. But this is only one part of an elaborate puzzle; lest we forget that we are dealing with certain narrative paradoxes, not to mention an assortment of linear and non-linear story elements each unfolding simultaneously. Just when we think we've got the whole film worked out, our perspectives immediately change, and our ideas are lost in the blink of an eye.

However, aside from thematic visual palindromes, what is most remarkable about La Jettée - and the reason it has retained its reputation as a work of genius - is the way in which Marker manages to relate his story of travel and movement through the use of still images. By presenting these pictures to us in a sort of photo-montage - complete with brooding voice-over and various sound effects - the director somehow manages to bring the stillness of his film miraculously to life. It is, without question, a work of pure, unadulterated imagination, and a staggering testament to Marker's genius ability to convey a multitude of feelings, ideas and emotions, through a series of simple, static, though nonetheless, deeply evocative images.",28M

For many years my grandfather enjoyed this film and suggested it to me for some time, finally being old enough to see it, I see why he and many others have enjoyed it. Epics are a kind of film that take an immense approach towards a story that needs a massive vision in order to tell such a story. David Lean took this massive vision in order to create something of epic scale and scope, which captured the extensiveness of an epic-genre film. Like most other epics, they take a great amount of time to tell their long stories, some ranging between three to five hours long which I will say may be too long for any kind of film. Lawrence of Arabia runs in at three hours and thirty-six minutes would seem like a rather long film, but this runtime feels appropriate when telling the progressional story of T.E. Lawrence building his character in great depth. Think of it like breaking the character of T.E. Lawrence into several parts such as a man, soldier, hero, leader, and advisor. In regards to the performances, Peter O'Toole brings T.E. Lawrence to life on multiple levels making us feel for his life journey and all other circumstances that he faces on that journey. All supporting and secondary performances adds a lot of good flare as well, especially from Omar Sharif's character. The direction by David Lean resonates every minute of this epic, Lean took such great care in creating a film of scale, meaning making this film both look and feel immense. Great utilization of wide lenses and shots allow the look of the film to larger than life, which in turn makes those particular shots more impactful.

I would recommend this film to anyone, even if it were just one time. This film has been on many ""top films or greatest films of all times"", after seeing it I feel that this film justifies its placement on those lists. Overall Star Rating: 8.4/10",3H48M

He leads the ""easy life"", his talent to cause trouble is only surpassed by his talent to disentangle himself from it — not always unscathed. One mid-summer holiday (the ""Ferragosto""), he meets by chance Roberto (Trintignant), a young law student in his early 20s, terribly shy, slightly bored, docile, self-effacing and inexperienced. Bruno practically drags Roberto to his convertible Lancia Aurelia and together they hit the road from Rome to Lazio and Tuscany, an initiation trip for Roberto — and when it's over, you know this movie will remain in your heart and mind forever. 

""Il Sorpasso"" is THE definitive combination of tragicomedy and road movie, and quite simply miraculous: how can a film be so funny AND emotional, light AND thought-provoking? I'd point out some of the reasons:

-- The fabulous script. Dino Risi (a bona-fide graduated psychiatrist, as his eye for psychological details shows) and experienced writing duo Ettore Scola/Ruggero Maccari (who had by then written about 18 scripts together!) create two of the most fascinating, three-dimensional characters in movies: Bruno's layers coming off and Roberto's self-discovery building up before our eyes. Bruno may be crass but also very smart: he outguesses all the dynamics of Roberto's country family instantly. Roberto may be the prey but a conniving one. The film excels in hilarious confrontational situations, finely drawn supporting characters (including gorgeous 17y.o. Catherine Spaak as Bruno's sensible daughter; and Luciana Angiolilo as Bruno's no- nonsense, mature ex-wife); endlessly quotable lines (including side-splitting remarks on Antonioni's ""L'Eclisse"" and the very spicy mating dance between Bruno and the Commendatore's wife); the underlying criticism of Italian society, which faced the last breath of the economic boom of the 1950s that ultimately deepened the gap between rich x poor, bourgeoisie x proletariat, North x South, leading to chaos in the 1970s; and, surely, the heart-stopping finale. 

-- Gassman and Trintignant's performances are nothing short of magical: they know these are once-in-a-lifetime roles and they squeeze all the juice out of them. Gassman (who said Bruno was probably his favorite film performance) builds Bruno with tour-de-force physicality and boundless energy, from risky-driving, water-skiing and doing handstands to highly elaborate body work (his ""choreography"" as he gets out of the ladies' toilet is worth a 1,000 lines). When was a scoundrel so complex and irresistible? Contrastingly, Trintignant (at 32 but completely convincing as a young student) goes inwards, acting with practically his eyes and mouth only, and yet we can see the full blossoming of his fascination with Bruno (notice the worshiping glow in his eyes as he listens to Bruno at dusk). When was a shy man ever performed with such intelligence, sensitivity and charm? To top it all, their interplay is wondrous: when they laugh heartily at the riotous hick twist party you know these two men have really bonded! 

-- Direction/cinematography: film encyclopedias affirm road movies existed long before ""Il Sorpasso"", but which, again? THIS is the first MODERN road movie: no back projections, no studio stuff, no dinosaur automobiles, no stunt doubles, but two stars really driving that triumph-of-design convertible Lancia Aurelia with its matchless horn sound on the real desert streets of Rome on a real Ferragosto holiday, and then on Italian roads doing real, risky ""sorpassi"". The film takes places in just over 24 hours and the lighting is always spot on.

-- the music: back in 1962, it was not that usual to use pop hits as a commentary for the action. But listen to the words of ""Guarda Come Dondolo"" (Look How I Swing) and how it perfectly matches Bruno's swinging behavior. Vianello, di Capri, Modugno...who can resist those Italian pop songs of the 60s? 

In the Brazilian DVD extras, Risi recalls the idea for ""Sorpasso"" came when he went on a road trip with a trouble-making, hyperactive producer, who would drive to Switzerland just to buy a pack of cigarettes. The film's finale was disputed during shooting: the producer wanted a happy ending to save expenses with the last scene (you'll know why). ""Il Sorpasso"" finally opened to unenthusiastic critical reception and mild box-office but immediately became a word-of-mouth fever and a smash hit in Europe, Latin America and the U.S., having influenced generations of road movies world- wide, most notoriously Dennis Hopper's ""Easy Rider"" (from the title to the finale) and Wim Wenders' masterpiece ""Im Lauf der Zeit"" (whose protagonists were named Bruno and Robert).

Since this is a film to watch over and over again, purchase your own copy and notice the innuendos concerning Bruno and Roberto's sexual profiles. You may laugh at how sex-deprived they are: Bruno brags a lot but he doesn't score once, not even with the waitress -- he's so sex starved he attacks the Commendatore's wife, his own ex-wife and even his own daughter in a black wig; Roberto is obviously a virgin. Or, if you're in such a mood, count the numerous gay undertones: Bruno, the narcissistic 40ish mamma's boy, using the ladies' toilet without a blink; Bruno teaching aunt Lidia how to apply cat-eye make-up; Bruno and Roberto's body contact especially after the night-club fight; Bruno giving up potentially easy conquests, such as the German girls and the waitress; Bruno instantly recognizing Occhio Fino is gay; Bruno jokingly to Roberto: ""Well, you know, I don't fancy men but if even if I did you're not my type""; or ""When we get back to Rome I'll introduce yo to mamma and we can see each other every day"" etc). It's just one more way to enjoy the richness of this brilliant comedy.

DO NOT MISS this insightful, hilarious, influential, fascinating, ageless film. ""Il Sorpasso"" is one of the finest character studies of all time, a legitimate masterpiece from an era when Italian cinema was the best around.",1H45M
Mahanagar,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjcyMjA5NTMtMDkwNS00ZDhhLTg3MjctYjk0MmY2ZmU2YjcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ3NzUxOTM@._V1_.jpg,Drama,"Anil Chatterjee,Madhabi Mukherjee,Jaya Bachchan,Haren Chatterjee",Satyajit Ray,"Mahanagar is a movie starring Anil Chatterjee, Madhabi Mukherjee, and Jaya Bachchan. Life at home changes when a house-wife from a middle-class, conservative family in Calcutta gets a job as a saleswoman.",1963-09-27,"lipstick,money,kolkata india,tradition versus modernity,toy gun",8.3,Peter_Young,2010-03-13,"Arati is a young middle-class housewife. The household includes Arati, her husband Subrata, who works as a bank clerk, their children and his elderly parents. Subrata is unable to support the entire family with his salary, and after a great deal of indecision, the couple decide that Arati must find a job. And she does so, much to the displeasure of his parents, who react with shame and anger when they find out that their daughter in-law has turned from a housewife into a working woman against tradition.

The story follows Arati's acclimation with her job as a sales woman, her growing independence, and her new relationships with people from different social and financial classes, one example being a young Anglo-Indian colleague named Edith whom she befriends. The real conflict, however, does not happen when Arati's in-laws start a silent ""cold war"", but when her husband himself loses his own job and Arati becomes the sole breadwinner of the family. Subrata loses self-respect and is filled with negative feelings of inferiority and shame.

This is the story of Satyajit Ray's extraordinary classic 'Mahanagar', a poignant, quiet and moving picture which depicts a whole world of conflicts resulting from modernisation and changing social and generational norms. Ray's portrayal of the urban India, its lifestyle and people, is brilliantly done. Everything about the film is, as expected, very authentic, very real and very easily identifiable with Ray's style of film-making. He makes the proceedings and the characters very interesting and very easy to relate to.

The film deals with the struggle of middle-class families to survive in the big city through their everyday hardships, but in the process, shows the gender role conflicts and criticises the hypocrisy of traditional conservativeness. One such instance is shown when Arati's father-in-law, a retired teacher who had complained that he was in need of a new pair of spectacles, now prefers going and begging from his former student rather than accepting money from his working daughter-in-law who 'breaks tradition'.

The relationships in Mahanagar are perfectly portrayed, whether it's Arati's relationship with her husband, with her kid, with her in-laws, with her employer. But the best thing about it is the portrayal of Arati's acquaintance with her new self. Her job provides her with confidence and self-belief as she grows increasingly independent, both socially and economically. Mainly due to her friendship with the Anglo-Indian Edith, who she would later stand up for, Arati learns to use lipsticks, wear dark fashionable glasses, speak more assertively and stand up against injustice, while still maintaining her individuality as a simple, unselfish woman. 

Madhabi Mukherjee is astonishing as Arati. She is a natural beauty, and acts with grace and dignity. She convincingly transforms from a simple housewife into a modern and smart woman of substance, always letting the viewer sense her struggle, confusion and pain. Anil Chatterjee is great as the slightly embittered yet loving husband. Jaya Bhaduri is completely lovable and charming in her debut role. Prasenjit Sarkar is cute as a button as Pintu. Vicky Redwood is quite nice though her line delivery is often weak. Haradhan Bannerjee is very sympathetic as Arati's boss though his character is slightly prejudiced.

Mahanagar is another example of Ray's indelible craftsmanship, of his superb storytelling and his exceptional ability to tell a universal story which is both moving and educative in a simple yet very effective way. The film's pace may be a bit slow, but it is steady enough, and the picture remains thoroughly and consistently engaging and captivating. The ending is bittersweet - sad yet optimistic, satisfying and inspiring. Mahanagar is overall a beautiful social drama; a classic and fascinating piece which is highly recommended.",2H2M

The film is an adaptation of a short story named Nashtaneer by Rabindranath Tagore. This review contains Ray's subtle use of metaphors while handling the plot which deserves appreciation along with its other technical perfections.

The metaphors used in this film are countable but very much catchy and pleasant if related properly with each other. Ray successfully employed the metaphors within the constraint of film techniques. The mentionable metaphors are Charu's opera-glass, caged birds, carpet-shoe and Sentinel newspaper etc. In the very poetic opening sequence of the film is not bereft of any intention by the director. The use of opera-glass vision or binocular-vision (which is masked-shot to be precise) is very grabbing. Charu sees the world through opera-glass. Even she sees her husband Bhupati with it once. The immediate and swift zoom-out after the gaze is praiseworthy. In the film, Charu sees the world through it but whoever she sees goes out of her limited vision. She cannot but forced to let them go out of her vision. By the end of the film, she once again takes refuge to her glasses. The focus of her glasses (a boat) moves on. The only person static in her opera-glass is Amal as seen in the garden sequence. But Amal sneaks off at last rendering Charu's opera-glass a constant metaphor of both escapism and a means of escape. Two times in the film, caged birds are seen within the frame of a shot's composition. That is a perfect metaphor for representing Charu and Amal to some extent as if they can fly but within a limited confinement where flying does not even mean anything fruitful. The carpet-shoe metaphor is a perfect example of Charu's growing weakness for Amal. Charu knitted the pair of shoe with meticulous attention for Bhupati. This was a sign of her loyalty to her husband. But she presents it to Amal and it was clear that she was presenting her affinity for Amal by doing this. When Amal leaves, she angrily collects the pair of shoe from Amal's room but there is no indication that she will give it to Bhupati either. The metaphoric indication is clear _ Charu can never present her love to anyone anymore. The Sentinel newspaper is last but not the least metaphor here. It shifts its representational position which makes it an interesting metaphor. At first it was a symbol of Bhupati's workaholic mind and was appreciable. Then it turns itself as an image of political consciousness of Bhupati and thus assumes a negative connotation to the viewer. It is because Bhupati's obsession with politics fruits a chasm in a social relationship between him and his wife Charu. Then the newspaper becomes a symbol of Bhupati's failure. At the last freeze shot, a copy of the newspaper is seen which connotes itself to be nothing more than a scrap and thus a metonymy of a broken house. Among other metaphors, betel and Bishwabondhu magazine are prominent ones.

It is literally very tough to find flaws with editing of such a meticulously knitted film. In fact, there is none to be mentioned. The transition between scenes is smoothed by very charming fade-ins and fade-outs. There are cuts but torrent of the plot remains uninterrupted. It must be mentioned that superimposition used in order to ensure the transition between scenes were very successful. The most interesting was the last three freezes. It is at once appreciable and bears evidence of cinematic craftsmanship of Satyajit Ray. He was accused by a critic that Charulata has been a bad adaptation. But within the technical sophistication of a film; the necessity of deducing, adding and altering is technically and literally undeniable. Thus the subtlety of editing makes Charulata one of the most entertaining and pioneering films in Bengali of all times. The editing aids to condense the story within an accepted time frame. In a nutshell, the crafty editing makes Charulata even critics' favourite as well.",1H57M

Not only the films looked grittier, violent and realistic; the characters in Leone's westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes, very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. ""Per Qualche Dollaro in più"" (""For a few dollars more""), is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful, raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of all-time.

""For a Few Dollars More"", the second in the so-called ""Dollars trilogy"" (a group of films by Leone with the same style), is the story of two different yet very similar men, Manco (Clint Eastwood) and the Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal named ""El Indio"" (Gian Maria Volontè). An unlikely alliance occurs between the two lone wolves as they decide to cooperate and divide the reward, but are these two killers after ""Indio"" for the same reason? 

Written by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone himself, the film's main characteristic is the complex moral code the main characters follow. They are no longer the perfect clean heroes of classic westerns, both Manco and the Colonel have well-developed attitudes, motivations and purposes; they are neither completely good nor completely bad, they are just real. The story unfolds with a fine pace and good rhythm, it is probably the best structured of the ""Trilogy"" and the easiest to follow. It is also the one that represents the elements of the Spaghetti Western style the best.

Stylistically, the film follows closely the conventions established by Leone's previous film but it takes them to the next level. The excellent use of minimalistic cinematography and the superb musical score by Ennio Morricone complement Leone's realistic vision of Westerns and completely redefined the genre's conventions. ""For a Few Dollars More"" is a violent tale of two hunters, and visually the film transmits the same emotions the characters feel. No more myths, the Westerns never felt this real.

Clint Eastwood's super performance as Manco is very important for the success of the film, as he is the one that takes the audience through this brave new world, however, the star of the film is Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer. In one of his best performances ever, Van Cleef manages to be both menacing and interesting, giving life to Leone's brilliant script with great talent. Gian Maria Volontè as Indio complements the two big talents as the crazed criminal with a dark past, he is the perfect counterpart of the two lone wolves.

""Per qualche dollaro in più"" is a near flawless movie, as every piece of the puzzle falls into the right place to create a marvelous and unforgettable picture. It's only minor problem may be the dubbing, but fortunately, it still is superior to the one heard in other Italian productions of the same time and it doesn't hurt the film. 

Fans will always argue about which of the three films of the ""trilogy"" is the best, and while personally I prefer ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" over this one, it is just a matter of personal taste as this film is as perfect as that one. A real classic that changed the face of Western as we knew it. 10/10",2H12M

The story is just so heart warming and also it's very cute and funny. The story has a memorable narration by Boris Karloff, also who sung the nasty grinch song. The story is so much fun to watch how one grinch could take Christmas so bitterly.

Each year down in Whoville, the who's are just getting ready for Christmas, it's always a joy each year to do so. They get presents, make a mighty delicious feast, and sing and dance with each other. But not everyone is so happy, there is a grinch that lives above them and doesn't want to celebrate Christmas one year. Maybe because his heart was just too small that he couldn't have a passion like the who's. But he's gonna steal Christmas along with his puppy, Max. But when he realizes that maybe Christmas might just mean a little bit more, he may have a change of heart.

How the Grinch Stole Christmas! is a must see film for the Christmas season. It's always a joy to watch each year and brings back happy memories of watching it with my family. The Grinch and Max are two of the most memorable characters since Santa Clause, this is such a touching story of how Christmas could be a little bit more than just gifts and dinner, but what it truly is; being with your family and friends and making sure that you are grateful for everything you have.

On top of that, I lost track of how many shots I was seeing on screen that I couldn't believe I was seeing. I fear battle scenes in future war movies I watch may never live up to this one. It looks so messy and spontaneous, yet it's so excellently and clearly captured, and it's beyond me how this even exists.",1H21M

Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.

Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.

The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.

While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.

Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.

All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.

Very highly recommended.",2H29M

I've wanted to see this film for thirty years.  Not because I've read or heard anything about it, but entirely because of the trailer I saw when it was first released, back when I was 14.  Although I now remember more the feelings the trailer inspired than the trailer itself, it still reminds me how awful trailers almost always are.  The trailer for ""Z"" was some the most intense, exciting few seconds of film I had ever seen, and I wanted to see more.  A brilliant ultra-short film production.  And it did it without revealing and spoiling the movie's story.  So when I finally did see ""Z"" I was able to enjoy something fresh and new.

It wasn't what I expected, but turned out to be one of the best political thrillers I've ever seen.  You don't really have to know Greek history to see it, in part because the movie never explicitly mentions Greece.  Better to do it the other way around, by getting swept up in the gritty often tawdry intrigues you will be learning Greek history without realizing it. Or if you are into conspiracies and cover-ups in general you'll learn how they really aren't the brilliantly crafted master-plans of distant omnipotent figures that most movies show, but are usually the creation of dull mediocrities, full of flaws, stupidities, and ham-fisted improvisations.  That they often succeed is more because of brute force than any innate cleverness.  This is a powerful and effective movie, which is almost certainly due to its being based closely on reality and the passions that inspired it's making, and from it not being a recycled and denatured Hollywood product.

It's impossible to sit through ACO and not have a reaction; whether it be shock, disgust or amazement. The savage tale of a brutal young droog and his subsequent ""reformation"" by the government is as shocking and thought-provoking as ever. 

While the film's depictions of violence and sex are what it's most known for, ACO works on far deeper levels. The disturbing portrayal of youth and its satirical depiction of a government's attempts to create a better society are brilliant, but the most fascinating aspect of ACO is the questions it poses about good and evil. While the crimes Alex commits at the beginning of the film are atrocious, what the government does to him is worse. The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice. People can denounce the film because of its brutal content, but the importance of the questions it poses can't be denied. 

Equally excellent to the film's content is the effort by the crew. Kubrick's perfectionism pays off well, as ACO in one of his most visually striking films. Malcolm MacDowell is nothing short of amazing as Alex. Kubrick's use of surreal imagery and set pieces, as well as the ingenious use of music to compliment the on-screen action, creates a world that perfectly reflects the protagonist's behavior and the government's policies. 

A Clockwork Orange is by no means an easy film to get through, as many will be turned off by the scenes of violence and rape. But this masterpiece is far more complex than a simple romp through a world of youthful violence. It's a rare example of film-making that demands that the viewer actually think.

*** 1/2 (out of 4) 

Concert film of the August 1st, 1971 benefit concert held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. George Harrison put together this all-star benefit to gather money for the issues going on in Bangladesh. The first part of the show featured Ravi Shankar performing some Indian music and then the more well-known artists hit the stage. Joining Harrison we get Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston, Leon Russell and towards the end Bob Dylan. Countless other musicians join the cause as the two shows were edited down to this one film. Overall I can't see how anyone would be disappointed in regards to the music because it's of the highest level from start to finish. Even if you overlook Ringo messing up his lyrics ""It Don't Come Easy"" the music is just so refreshing and of the highest level. Harrison really hits a home run on numbers like ""My Sweet Lord,"" ""Here Comes the Sun,"" ""Something,"" and ""Bangla Desh."" Other highlights including a rocking version of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" from Russell and a show-stopping number by Preston. With all of that said, the greatest moment of the concert comes when Bob Dylan walks onto the stage. You can easily tell that the producers thought this was the high point as well considering they included four of his songs here. This was only Dylan's second live show since the notorious electric tour of 1966 so you can tell he's nervous but as a die-hard fans it's usually these moments where he shines the brightest. He delivers wonderful performances of ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,"" "" Blowin' in the Wind"" and perhaps one of the greatest live performances of ""Just Like a Woman."" On a technical level the music sounds extremely crisp and for the most part the video footage is just fine. Fans of these musicians will certainly want to check this film out as the music still stands up strong all these years later.",1H43M

The issue of ethics in Documentary films fascinates me, and Wiseman's films are perfector a discussion of that type.  In my entry on ""Basic Training"", I discussed what role the audience plays in judging a films ethical standpoint.  I continue that discussion here.

 In ""Juvenile Court"" there is a scene in which a psychologist questions a 15-year-old boy who has been accused of molesting a small girl he was baby-sitting.  We later meet the mother of the girl who seems nervous and sexually obsessed.  We see the boy agree to take a lie detector.  Then we see some attorneys, some counselors, and the judge in the case discuss whether or not the mother might have fabricated the charges.  That is the last we see of that case.  As Thomas R. Atkins wrote in a 1974 article in ""Sight and Sound"":  ""The characters have spoken for themselves, and each viewer can have his own reaction, make his own judgment according to his particular prejudices and values.  The implications of the legal issues and human attitudes extend far beyond the innocence or guilt of this specific defendant, raising tough questions about the system of juvenile justice as well as the condition of society in general.""

But some could argue that the goal of documentary is to present the facts and not to make ambiguous statements about the issues.  Then again, it could be said that documentary films are not the same as news programs, and should be about representing the ambiguities of life, and as Atkins suggests, to use the events in the film to focus on broader issues.",2H24M

Unknown to them, however, one of their victims works for a vicious local gangster named Doyle Lonnegan, and when Lonnegan finds out what has happened he has Luther murdered. Hooker is not a violent man by nature and admits that he does not know much about killing, but nevertheless wishes to take revenge for his partner's death. He decides that the best way is to hurt Lonnegan's pride by relieving him of some of his wealth. He joins forces with another con man named Henry Gondorff, and together they come up with an elaborate plan, not only to cheat Lonnegan, but also to do it in such a way that he never realises that he has been cheated. The plot unfolds with great ingenuity; until the final denouement the audience are never quite sure which developments are for real and which are part of the elaborate scheme.

Crime thrillers set during this period are normally associated with the classic `film noir' style, with its dark, brooding, cynical atmosphere. In `The Sting', however, George Roy Hill deliberately sets out to create a very different mood. The style is almost the exact opposite of film noir. The acting is heavily stylised (as is the scenery), and the division of the film into sections with titles such as `The Hook' or `The Line' is reminiscent of the formal division of a stage play into acts and scenes. The film is not in black-and-white but in bright colour, and the mood, far from being heavy and brooding, is light and cheerful. Scott Joplin's music, although written slightly earlier than the period in which the film is set, fits this mood perfectly. The major actors all play their parts perfectly- Robert Shaw as the glowering, menacing Lonnegan, Robert Redford as the young, idealistic Hooker (insofar as a con-man can be said to be an idealist), and Paul Newman as the older, more experienced and laid-back Gondorff. There are also good contributions from Charles Durning as the corrupt policement Lieutenant Snyder and Robert Earl Jones as Luther.

Despite the cheerful mood, the film has serious undertones in keeping with its themes of revenge and murder. I am not usually a great admirer of what are known as `heist' or `caper' movies, as I feel that too often they glamourise crime and dishonesty. `The Sting', however, is different. Hooker and Gondorff live in a world where the moral order has broken down. The police are hopelessly corrupt- Snyder, the one representative we see of the forces of law and order, is on Lonnegan's payroll. There is no chance of Hooker getting justice for his friend's murder through the normal channels; the only way in which this can be achieved is to go outside the law. Where the police are crooked, only the criminals can execute justice. The emotional satisfaction we feel at the end of the film is because a sort of moral order has finally been restored and, moreover, because this has been done without anyone getting injured except Lonnegan's wallet. An excellent film, which well deserved its Academy Award. 9/10.",2H9M

Certainly the director's style is fresh and arresting, and the performances (if that's the right word for a 'fly-on-the-wall' directorial style), including the remarkable look-alike actor who plays Munch, are uniformly excellent. The art direction is also particularly impressive, evoking both late 19th century middle class and bohemian Europe with real pungency. The film concentrates on some of the main formative influences on Munch's art: his family relations, circle of friends and lovers. Munch's poor health as a child (you would never guess from this film that he actually lived to the age of 80) is given much prominence. The film, however, could not be described as a biography of the artist. It has nothing to say about his commercial success (which was not insignificant by 1897), what paintings he sold, how he supported himself, or anything about the second half of his life. For me, the last 30 minutes of the film seemed repetitive and, with the accumulation of repeated images and scenes, suffered from the law of diminishing returns. Perhaps the film's greatest strength is its exposition of the circumstances under which several key works in Munch's oeuvre were created. The depictions of the act of painting – often the weakest element in such biopics – are brilliantly handled by Watkins. Worth seeing. But worth owning?",3H30M

The film gives us accounts of one Russian captain's friendship with Dersu.They are together through thick and thin and Dersu even rescues him from a blizzard when they are stuck on a frozen lake.Dersu has all the natural senses and therefore knows when he is in danger.He knows everything by looking and observing the landscape around him.

So when he kills the tiger,its like a spell has been cast on him.Or is it just his imagination?His people believe in a ghost that rules the taiga,Kanga.He thinks Kanga will punish him in some way.Soon his fears start to get real.He cant kill his prey for food that he needs for living because his eyesight dramatically worsens.One frightening night(my favorite scene) it gets too much for him,listening to the howling wind in the dark,waiting for Kanga to send a tiger to kill him.And captain Arseniev,seeing the horror that struck him,offers him to come with him to his hometown.It happens so.

Throughout the film,you cant help but wonder what will happen to Dersu.Not only because in the beginning Arseniev searches for his grave,in retrospection,but also because he is one lonely,sad man who lives only by hunting.There is no place for him but the taiga.And when the tragedy happens,its hard not to feel remorse and pity the old Dersu.His world has come crashing down.The end specially is painful and shows that there is no mercy in this world for a man who falls from grace in his own homeground.

Should I find I am incorrect I will edit my review.

*My review is based on looking at a subject objectively, which this documentary is not. If you want to understand the situation as a whole, you need to go far beyond this documentary. If you simply want to be manipulated by the creator into accepting his point of view, I would give this 10 stars.

Communist terrorism started long before Pinochet. Since 1965 left wing groups had been committing murder, planting bombs and committing other terorist actions. All wtih the help of the marxist communist Cubans and Russians, they murdered hundreds, planted bombs and other acts of violence. All with the aid of the usual cast of characters, the soviet union and cuba. Both active in providing traing and support to the terorists.

Also Salvadore Allende is painted as this wonderful fellow democratically elected by the overwheling support of the people. He was a racist and was elected with 36% of the vote. Not exactly overwhelming support so the potrayl by guzman and the other left wing writers is a gross misrepresentation of the truth.

All these facts mr guzman conveniently forgets because he wants you to believe allende was this wonderful human being who was going ot save the world. Well he wasn't. He bankrupted the economy, stole private property and circumvented the Chilean congress like a good dictator would.

Look at Chile now vs. it's neighbors. It has the strongest and most stable economy in Latin America. Had allende remained, Chile would look more like Venezuela with the starvation, repression, violence and poverty that is the hallmark of all communist/ marxist governments.

When you watch a documentary of any kind, the truth lies not in what they tell you but what they don't tell you and this is a great example.",3H11M

A newly wedded husband plays a practical joke on his wife's family with full support from his wife and friends.",1975-04-11,"neo screwball comedy,brother in law brother in law relationship,chauffeur,prank,breaking the fourth wall",8.3,jmathur_swayamprabha,2011-09-14,"Today is 14th September, known as Hindi Day as per the Indian constitutional provisions. On this occasion, I am reviewing a classic comedy whose theme is the usage of the two languages - Hindi and English whose propagators are mostly seen at loggerheads in India. Yes, no prizes for guessing. It is Chupke Chupke (1975) which is unarguably one of the best Bollywood commedies of all times.

Chupke Chupke (quietly) is the story of Parimal Tripathi (Dharmendra), the professor of Botany who falls in love with a student of Botany - Surekha (Sharmila Tagore). After marriage, he comes to know of her fondness towards her brother-in-law or Jijaji (elder sister's husband) - Raghavendra (Om Prakash) who has not been able to attend their marriage. Just to prove himself before his wife, he masquerades as a driver speaking pure Hindi (without any use of English words) and enters Raghavendra's household. What follows is a two hours long laugh-riot for the audience in which, in addition to the mentioned ones, several characters get involved viz. Parimal's friend - Sukumar (Amitabh Bachchan), his another friend - Prashant (Asrani), Prashant's sister-in-law (wife's sister) - Vasudha (Jaya Bhaduri) and many more. Comic situations keep on coming before the spectators till the finale is reached with the truth being revealed before Raghavendra who acknowledges the wittiness of his brother-in-law, i.e., Parimal.

Legendary director - Hrishikesh Mukherjee has directed this movie whose script and dialogues have been written by another Bollywood legend - Gulzaar. It's not a slapstick comedy. It's a situational one whose brilliant script makes it a winner. Right from the very start to the very finish, there is no dearth of laughs for the audience. And the perfect comic timings of the lead characters, especially Dharmendra complement the script to serve its purpose to make the audience laugh again and again.

The inherent message is no less useful and worth remembering. No language is superior or inferior to any other one. Language is a medium of communication for the human-beings who have no business making fun of any language. The way Hindi is respectable, the same way English is. Each one of the two has its own positives (and negatives too) and it's in the interest of the Indians to appreciate the worth of both without mocking any of them. 

Sachin Da (S.D. Burman) has composed pretty good music for the movie. The best song is - Abke Sajan Saawaan Mein sung by Lata. Other songs are also apt according to the mood of the movie. Anand Bakshi has penned appropriate lyrics for them.

Performance wise talking, this movie is definitely one of the best movies of Dharmendra. This versatile actor has proved quite emphatically that he is not only skilled in serious roles but he has no match in comedy also. Interestingly, Bollywood's most popular movie -Sholay which contains Dharmendra's another memorable comic performance was released in the same year. Dharmendra has left no stone unturned in making the audience laugh right from the beginning to the end. Om Prakash is the second best and Amitabh Bachchan is the third best in this work. Asrani, Sharmila Tagore, Jaya Bhaduri, David, Keshto Mukherjee etc. all have done their parts well and generated showers of laughter for the viewers.

The technical and production value aspects of the movie adhere to the simplicity doctrine of Hrishi Da. Editing is good. Length is also perfect. Summing up, Chupke Chupke is a flawless movie.

Surprisingly, Chupke Chupke was not a box office hit when released. However, now it is considered a classic comedy which has unlimited repeat value. The way, the admirers of Sholay can watch it umpteen number of times, the same way Chupke Chupke can also be watched countless number of times and every time the laughter is guaranteed for the viewer.",2H26M

But this movie is different.Coming from someone who is steeped in the tremendous comic timings of the southern movies this is indeed a very formidable feat.

The setting,Mumbai in the early 70s I think,is nostalgic.One does not have to be born there nor have experienced it to get this feeling.It is plain nostalgic.Take a 1970 Reader's Digest and flip through the pages. The bell bottomed Male models,the polka dotted saris and the large ortem fans are what one sees in the movie.

Amol Palekar and the lead heroine(I think Someone named Vidhya) are delightful to watch as the quintessential young shy middle class people with a feeling towards each other.The villain/comic Nasrani is also irritating to the right degree and begging for a comeuppance from the meek hero.Amol Palekar's ""revenge dreams"" are awesome in their humour.

Like it happens, more often than not, with masterpieces, it signed in a rather direct way the lives of the ones who live it in a movie theater and the ones who made it. Scorsese being the giant that he is, survived it and will continue startling us I'm sure but I also bet that for years everything he did was compared to this movie. De Niro and his ""You looking at me"" became such an iconic phrase that even he himself ended up impersonating it.

Everything that could be funny (and that's what `Indul a bakterház' is supposed to be in the first place) is left out or reduced, so only those can laugh who have read the book and are, by the film scenes, reminded of it. I don't know whether this is the sense of a film, and, as I had read the book quite some months before, it didn't work with me either.

My criticism refers to the producers, the director and the bad sound quality (it really disturbs one if the synchronization isn't professionally done), but it doesn't concern the actors. Their performances are immaculate without exception, and they do really good jobs in portraying Rideg's characters, although had created them all rather excessive and stylized.

The others I've watched, ""Primate"", ""Law and Order"", and ""Titticut Follies"" I would rank slightly above ""Welfare"" for the simple reason that they are harder hitting films. ""Welfare"" is very long and totally mesmerizing but it's all about the process of waiting and people drifting endlessly through the system. It's all conversations between welfare caseworkers and people who are trying to get their checks. 

As usual, Wiseman finds some of most astonishing footage imaginable. Some of the stuff its hard to fathom how he managed to film it. You wonder if the people knew they were being filmed, and if so, did they care? They don't seem to. It was shot in 1974, and presumably on film, so the cameras would have been noticeable. The thing I love about Wiseman is that he doesn't stand in judgement. He just shows. And when you expect his camera to pull away it doesn't. And then something even more astonishing happens. 

Admittedly, in ""Welfare"" the astonishment is on a more subtle level than in some of his other films. There are no moments that make your jaw drop in horror at the human condition like in Wiseman's ""Law and Order"" when two cops chokehold a cowering prostitute into oblivion or the nightmarish talent show in ""Titticut Follies"". 

The moments that stand out in ""Welfare"" are the smaller ones. The way one couple's story about how badly they need their welfare check slowly dissolves as they get caught in one lie after another. The hippie girl who complains about her apartment being declared an unfit home for her infant just because her boyfriend's ""diseased"" dog also lives there. The way one caseworker (who seems like a wimp at first) is able to firmly (and justly) stick up for one of his cases. 

But the real treat of seeing a Frederick Wiseman documentary cannot fully be described in words. I think he is the greatest documentary filmmaker in history. His films are truly like social x-rays. Every one of his films I've seen is far and away better than any other documentary I've seen by any other filmmaker.",2H47M

Some friends were going, & it happened that Philip Glass was due to be in the cinema for an after-screening interview. I wasn't a huge fan of Philip Glass, I'd never heard of Koyaanisqatsi or Godfrey Reggio: but what the hell, I went along, expecting some sort of nicely-filmed but vaguely-boring worthy documentary.

An hour & a half later, I was - and I'm having to try very hard to find adjectives here - in fact I'm failing. It was The-Thing-That-You-Can't-Even-Tell-Someone-What-It-Is. Completely transfixed, transported, for 90 minutes of my life.

This film has no dialogue. It has no actors, apart from everyone & everything that Ron Fricke's camera touches. It has no plot, apart from just the simple, complex, unfolding story of the world.

The truth is, of all the films that people feel have really made an impact on their lives - and you only need to read through this lengthy thread to see how many of those people there are - this is one of the hardest to communicate to someone who hasn't actually seen it. You can compare it, perhaps, to things they might have seen - but there aren't that many to compare to. It has a kind of poetry on a whole different level from, for example, Man with a Movie Camera. The only things that spring to mind for me are Orphee or Last Year at Marienbad, but these are completely different kinds of movie, and even people who don't like them might be totally taken apart by Koyaanisqatsi.

Sure you could - rightly - use phrases like ""breathtaking cinematography"" or ""unforgettable images"". You could praise the music (which really opened my ears to Philip Glass). You could point out, as many have done, how the film made you look again at the world, & at your own place in it. Or you could try to relay its ""environmental"" message - and there are people, especially those who take any implied criticism of our species' waste and cruelty as a kind of personal insult, who will not like that message.

But none of these things would come close to capturing what makes this film so special. Like trying to explain ""red"" to someone who's never seen colours. You have to experience it. If possible in a cinema, sitting right down at the front, completely immersed in the screen and its images.

It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind 'The Godfather'.

But it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as ""tackiness"" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the ""remake""! 

Al Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time!

There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's theme', 'Push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental.

There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother's.

About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what ""Scarface"" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn't be as effective without him!

Steven Bauer shines as Tony's friend Manny.

Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.

Then there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.

The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.

""Scarface"" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!",2H50M

But hell, this film was made long ago in councils, where people were even sent to prison who smoked weed. This film was shown to me by one of my new friends, whose parents had long left for emigration from the Soviets when there was a hateful regime of military tyranny and the Cold War. Monster frames change very quickly and I did not even have time to understand what is drawn on the screen. The monster was just disgusting and did not want to look at it for a long time. In general, everything that this crocodile turned into is not clear and there is little similarity with real animals, the only thing that was very similar in one frame to a gorilla. I don't understand why it was necessary to shoot so many shots about monsters and it was impossible to draw it once, but more believable. The director of this film is probably a mentally ill person with a crazy fantasy. Then it became generally not clear what was happening on the screen. The monster comes to an elderly couple home and meets there with a fish boy who wants to save a fisherman. The fish boy begins to distract the monster from a middle-aged couple and tells his story. Here begins the real madness of the director's psycho. There were no subtitles in the film and my friend translated it to me, he knows Russian from his parents. He paused the DVD so often that it would explain the whole nightmare, and I really thought that he would break the DVD. I got the opinion that my friend is as crazy as a director when he started telling me a monologue of a fish guy. This is complete crazy nonsense! What did the Russians want to show in this film?

The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, through the eyes of rival composer, Antonio Salieri. The film is complete with an insightful script (courtesy of Mr. Shaffer), magnificent acting, wondrous sets and costume designs, incredible choreography (thanks to Twyla Tharp), and, above all, the glorious music of Mozart himself.

The movie of Salieri's life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.

The priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father's untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how ""The Creature"" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of  music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri's heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.

As the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions.

The movie won eight Academy Awards in March of 1985. The only reason it did not win nine was that Tom Hulce was nominated for best actor instead of best supporting actor. He actually was in a supporting role, and in a strange twist of irony, F. Murray Abraham won the best actor statuette; citing probably the only time when Salieri beat out Mozart in anything.

The movie itself was shot in Prague where Milos Forman said ""(It) is a gem because it's possible to pivot the camera a full three hundred and sixty degrees and never encounter a modern vision."" Very few new sets had to be built, as the scenes and buildings they found were quite often apropos to their needs.

Amadeus works well on virtually every cinematic plane that exists. It is a masterpiece that must be viewed multiple times to receive what the film has to offer. The emotions of humanity, through the eyes of the troubled Salieri, indeed speak for all of mediocrity. He is their champion and their king.",2H40M

It is as near to being perfect as any I have ever seen. I will not say that it is much better than Alien - which is just about near to being perfect also. But I do love all the characters in this movie. I have rarely seen a movie where all the characters were so well developed. Even most serious dramas seldom develops each character so completely. None of these characters are stereotypes even Paul Reiser as Burke, although the slimy company/government man villain is a prerequisite in disaster type movies. I would almost say that my favorite is Michael Beihn as Hicks, just because I like his work & consider him to be underrated. But I also like Lance Henriksen as Bishop, William Hope as Lt. Gorman, Bill Paxton as Hudson, and of course, Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez. I liked all of these characters. I cared about their lives & deaths. The final scene for Gorman & Vasquez still chokes me up after seeing it many times. 

I am not ignoring Sigourney Weaver or Carrie Henn. Ripley is the template for the modern action heroine. In the 24 years since Alien, few have been able to measure up to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Even in Alien 3 & 4, Ripley was still powerful, despite the 3ed rate quality of the movies. As for Carrie Henn as Newt, she was the emotional heart of Aliens.

Thank God for Ben Elton is all we can say. Series 2 may have ended, but Blackadder is far from over. It has reached a peak, and will stay at that peak forever, and become one of Britain's best comedies, and a highlight of the 80s. Anyway, let's start the review of the episode.

Chains spends no time lingering on details - Blackadder is kidnapped about 3 minutes into it, with Melchett. Blackadder's true colours are revealed in this episode - he is nasty to everyone, even if he is stuck with them, and never loses his cool. Hugh Laurie is great as Prince Ludwig - from here onwards, he will appear in every Blackadder episode. The episode once again reaches hilarious heights - Melchett's shameful past is revealed too subtly, though. We once again switch between Blackadder's situation and Queenie's situations, but while Blackadder's scenes have brains, Queenie's situations aren't brilliantly written and should have been left out. The episode is clearly resolved in the end - as it is with all Blackadder episodes - but there is a surprise ending - do not press stop on the credits sequence.

On the whole, Chains is a very funny episode, and a worthy close to what has now become a great comedy. Spiffing close to a spiffing series, which is soon to become even greater. 9/10",

Full Metal Jacket is a great movie. Not the best from Kubrick, but works great as a war film. The plot is about a group of soldiers who are turned into killers in marine training, and are then sent off to the Vietnam War.

Kubrick once again does a great job at directing. Modine, D'Onofrio, Baldwin, and Howard give worthy performances, while Ermey gives an Oscar worthy (not even nominated) performance and steals the show. This is a very realistic look at Vietnam, while the battle scenes and script just aren't as satisfying as they are in the second half. Still, it is a wonderful film.

People tend to say that Abbas Kiarostami's style is a dead-crawl pace coupled with dry documentary images, but I've found his films to be wonderfully unravelling puzzles, full of frustrations and moments of perfect understanding.  At times I think the key to Kiarostami's work is to simply earn it - the film may seem hard at first, you might be lost in the story, but don't give up!  If you hang in there, you'll be rewarded with an unforgettable ending, like the one here in Close-up.",1H38M

It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.

It feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly £6.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.

Tarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.

Yet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of ""ultra-violence,"" it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there's the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.

And that's the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it's crammed packed full of memorable things. A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it's one of the very best. 9/10",1H39M

A bold statement I know, especially when one considers the original series of Star Trek which is certainly the genre's most celebrated. It's true to say that Star Trek has had a much greater cultural impact and has lasted longer than any other SF show, but when watching it again, it has dated. I'm not questioning the brilliance of some early episodes - they're still well written and thought provoking - season 1 of the old series is still fantastic. However, Babylon 5 is the Star Trek for today in that it deals with issues in a modern context. Whereas ST was a bunch of cleverly disguised morality plays about 1960's issues like communism, nuclear war and racial prejudice, B5 deals with social control, economics, war, governmental corruption, social psychology and spirituality. Although the issues discussed in Star Trek haven't gone away, they're not foremost in the psyche of mr average anymore.

Alongside the fact that B5 discusses issues at the forefront, it has many other virtues. The main one is that the story continues from episode to episode - even now when I re-watch season one (just released on DVD) I can see events taking shape that will lead to major plotlines in future years. I'm not just talking about Data gradually becoming more human or Worf tussling with the dying Kilingon Empire every 7 or 8 episodes ... I'm talking about characters and plots that can be seen to be evolving each week without an obvious good guys vs bad guys scenario.

I can't remember how many times I've watched a B5 episode and had a flashback to an earlier one - the sudden realisation of the importance of an event that seemed insignificant is very satisfying. Even in the 5th series, you'll be thinking back to an episode in series 1 and feeling smug that you got it.

'Ahhhh! That's what it meant!' You'll be saying that a lot.

The characters are wonderfully fleshed out by some great actors. They're complex beings who have to deal with temptations and failings as well as triumphs and successes. Sometimes things go deeply wrong and (get this Trek Fans) IT'S NOT SORTED OUT BY THE END OF THE EPISODE!! That's right - people change realistically - everything's not reset each week! Don't get me wrong - I'm a huge Trek fan myself, but it's always irked me that everything is just so hunky dory (don't people have arguments on the enterprise?)

It's very satisfying to see a character that you've come to know and love wrestle with their morals and sometimes make the wrong choices (just like we all do.) In the end, we all knew the various crewmembers of the Enterprise would do the right thing. You can't say the same for the characters on B5 - they're fallible and thus much more interesting.

There's many other great things about the show, but for me, the story and the characters are the most important. Sure, I know it doesn't look as expensive as Star Trek and yes I know it's hard to get into because it's not a whole load of 'one shot' episodes! If you like Star Trek and consider yourself intelligent - step up to the next level and watch B5!

I guarantee that if you stick with it for a while, you'll be glad you did because the payoffs are enormous. If My girlfriend can like it - anyone can....",

The early videos weren't shot in the best quality, but ironically those videos tend to reflect their better music, because as you'll see as you gradually progress into the DVD you'll see the video quality enhance but the songs become less familiar & popular. The ideas of most of their videos are random and yet sometimes very literal at the same time. A majority of those videos were produced during the early stages of video editing magic and CGI, so they do seem rather kitsch, but after all, isn't that Devo in a nutshell?

These phrases, which have persisted as common knowledge among the African-American community during last several decades, have become familiar to the non-hyphenated Americans in the 90s, thanks to the films such as Boyz N the Hood and He Got Game. Among them, Hoop Dreams, a documentary that follows two black youths during a five-year period, is the most objective and the most quiet, but the most powerful statement to represent the disadvantaged youth in urban America.

The film reveals the pattern they follow. Being deluded by the luxurious surface of pro sports, they neglect education and then ending up going nowhere. The community suffers the vicious cycle and their feelings that the system exploits them remain.

Riefenstahl was a brilliant technical innovator, whose status among the top film-makers of the century has never been challenged. I would be very surprised if film schools ignore her work.

On the other hand, she has lied and lied again about her relationship with the Nazis. For example, she has claimed that she met after the war all the Roma and Sinti prisoners whom she used as extras. They were sent to Auschwitz after she had finished with them. She has tried to persuade us that she was a naive ingenue who knew nothing about Nazism and who was horrified that her films were used as propaganda.

Eisenstein was an unapologetic believer in communism, although of a very different kind from that of Stalin. His relations with the regime were extremely difficult after Stalin took power, because of his politics, his artistic techniques and the amount of time he spent abroad. He was forced to write self-denunciations for his deviations from party orthodoxy. Of the five films he made in Russia during the last 20 years of his life, two were banned and two were destroyed.

His films are marred at points by traces of immediate political concerns, as when he hints in ""The Battleship Potemkin"" (1925), set in 1905, at the ""petty-bourgeois individualism"" of some Kronstadt sailors, to justify the slaughter of the Kronstadt soviet in 1921. Nevertheless, several of his films are clearly great achievements, despite all the censorship he had to endure.

As for other film-makers who were propagandists for the Soviet Union, as opposed to Russians who made films, such as Mikhail Romm and his pupils, the obvious examples are the documentarists Karmen and Vertov. Karmen is hardly known in the English-speaking world. Vertov is much better known, as a technical innovator and theoretician of film, but his career was destroyed by the rise of ""socialist realism"".

Eisenstein was never a propagandist for Stalin in the way that Riefenstahl was for Hitler, and the visibility of other Stalinists is decidedly limited. Of course, one could decide that every unpurged Russian director was a Stalinist, or every unpurged American director was a McCarthyite.",3H3M

Only the evil white Americans ""stole"" the land and displaced rightful owners.

Also, much is made of the extermination of Indians. I used to live in Tuscarawas County, Ohio. There were once Tuscarawas Indians, but they were extinct, because the Iroquois had warred upon them and broken up their villages and driven every last one they didn't kill or enslave into the forests where they died of exposure and hunger. This was repeated throughout the continent and the history of the American Indian. They should surely have understood genocide and extermination of enemies, because that is how they regularly waged war.

Every piece of land in the world, from the Americas, to Europe, to Asia, Africa and Australia was conquered and displaced the previous residents, most many, many times over, throughout history. But the only time conquering territory and displacing and killing the previous inhabitants is evil: when the Americans did it. The Americans, the most selfless, righteous and generous people history has ever known, who gave their blood and treasure to rescue the Cubans, Phillipinos, all of Europe twice, the Far East, Iraq and Afghanistan and Korea and Vietnam and unlike all the superpowers of the past, the USA never took territory nor enslaved people other than in the contiguous N. American continent (Hawaii joined voluntarily).

Ken Burns did an admirable job of not taking sides in The Civil War, notwithstanding Barbara Fields constant scolding (""I grow impatient with people who say Lincoln couldn't have freed the slaves faster because of the times""). The PC left got to him about that, I'm sure, and everything he's done since then, Jazz, Baseball, The War, The West has focused on minorities, white man's injustice, women's rights and over-played these groups actual contribution, notwithstanding 99% of the history, like the Civil War, was driven by the people who actually did the actions that made history. Like it or not, Howard Zinn fans, those were white Americans.

Quit distorting history with liberal guilt. The conquest of North America was the greatest thing that ever happened in the history of the world, and had the most beneficial results for the entire world, blacks, Indians and all other minorities included. They are all better off in the United States, imperfect as it was and is, than anywhere else in the world.",

Van Sant got an Oscar nominated performance for Matt Damon and a Supporting Actor Oscar for Robin Williams as the psychologist who counsels Damon.

Will Hunting is this average lower middle class kid from South Boston who was in the foster care system and suffered a lot of abuse while growing up. He has some low level jobs, he's constantly getting in trouble with the law for minor scrapes, and he's a functioning genius who for kicks solves a highly complex mathematical equation between buffing floors at MIT.

Which perks the interest of Stellan Skarsgaard highly touted mathematics professor there. He feels and I agree with him that one of the worst sins in the world is wasting the talent the Deity blesses you with, whatever it is. After a succession of therapists who are unable to cope with Damon's genius, Robin Williams gets his turn at bat.

Robin Williams one of the wildest, wackiest, most innovative comics that ever walked the earth, drops all of that to deliver a highly sensitive performance as the psychologist who finally reaches Damon on some level. What Damon does with it is for you to see Good Will Hunting for.

Some of that breakthrough is achieved with the help of Minnie Driver, a British student at Harvard who falls hard for the blue collar Will Hunting. Most of it is achieved though in the film's key scene as Ben Affleck tells him that no matter what your IQ is, if you don't use it and move up and on, you're the stupidest guy here. It's one of Affleck's best scenes in his whole career on film.

I've known a few Will Huntings in my day, blessed with talent I would like to have had and who threw it away for a combination of reasons. One in particular I knew back in the Eighties was a kid who originally grew up in Virginia in the Blue Ridge Mountain country to some really uneducated hicks. They discovered he was gay and immediately had him committed. Back in the day, they did all kinds of things to him like electroshock therapy and guess what, it all didn't work. But it left him a twisted and bitter person who gravitated to the new gay rights movement because it was something that finally validated him as a human being.

He also was blessed with an incredible baritone singing voice, he could have sang opera had that been trained instead of his parents trying to change his orientation. But when I last saw him in the middle Eighties no one had or could reach him. He made a living running a cleaning service for apartments. If he couldn't sing militant songs of protest he wasn't interested, even if he could have reached millions more with his issues had he studied, learned, and developed.

Unlike Will Hunting, Jimmy Flowers wasn't reached as far as I know. But Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in writing their Oscar winning original screenplay could have known him. So I'm sure they won't mind if I dedicated this review to Jimmy whether he's alive or no longer with us. 

I'm sure there are Jimmy Flowers and Will Huntings that we've all known and hopefully we have the wit to recognize the talent whatever it is and the encouraging nature to make people develop that talent.",2H6M

It's easy to understand why there are over 100 reviews of ""Children of Heaven"". Normally, that simple fact would have dissuaded me from adding a review of my own. But, as I'm sure others have felt, this film so overwhelmed me with joy, I feel obligated to share my feelings with all who would listen! 

After watching ""Children"", it occurred to me that I have, perhaps, never seen an Iranian film I didn't like. This film celebrates the essence and innocence of youth, with an unencumbered intensity, with such unpretentious panache, that any comparison to American films that make an effort along similar lines, regrettably, seem rather empty, almost laughable in comparison. 

The fierce sibling rivalry so familiar in the majority of American movies is replaced here by a warm, caring fraternal relationship based on love, consideration, self-sacrifice and mutual respect. These little Muslim children demonstrate the most exemplary of true Christian behavior in both word and deed. I hope that here, in America, this opinion can be stated clearly, in a review such as this one, without fear of provoking a mindless outpouring of reactionary negative clicks. 

I feel more than a tinge of remorse, even embarrassment, when I think of the millions of Iranians who see far too many American films where children are portrayed, more often than not, as selfish, wise-cracking, foul-mouthed, bullying, disrespectful, totally inconsiderate little brats. To make matters worse, this abhorrent behavior is too often viewed as copacetic, or worse, even exemplary, something that kids today often strive to imitate. 

Some have commented that ""Children"" seems incomplete or leaves them feeling somewhat bewildered or left them hanging in mid-air. All I can say to them is just reflect carefully for a moment on the value systems of the kids in the movie...maybe then you will be able to feel much more satisfied with this great cinematic experience.

This dark comedy drama marks two fantastic feature film debuts with Alan Ball as writer and Sam Mendes as director (both winning oscars for their sterling efforts).

Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a man on the brink of a mid-life crisis, who suddenly becomes obsessed with one of his teenage daughters friends played by Mena Suvari. His daughter (Thora Birch) is, as Lester tells us; ""a typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused..."". And his wife Caroline (Annette Bening) has an obsession of her own, her public appearance.

Life starts off on a downer for the Burnhams and their new neighbours the Fitts despite their lives looking good from the outside.

As life begins to improve (with most of the main characters finding what they think is love or new relationships) it soon all comes crashing down in the climactic final day.

The writing is nothing short of brilliant and made even more amazing by knowing that it comes from a first time feature film screen writer Alan Ball (who had had years of prior experience writing TV sitcoms -  not  that you'd be able to guess from the tone of this film).

The directing is on a par with the writing and Sam Mendes manages to get some brilliant performances from the great cast, who are all faultless. No doubt Mendes' theatre directing past played a huge part in directing the actors so well.

Another person worthy of a mention is the late director of photography Conrad L. Hall, another one of the five oscar recipients for this film.

All the elements in this film gel perfectly together to make one superb masterpiece. Not one person, either cast or crew, steals this film or does anymore than anyone else to make this film what it is. Truly an ensemble effort. 10/10.",2H2M

But it is reminiscent of a range of novels, the kind where modern big-city dwellers find themselves thrust into a preindustrial and typically magical setting. It's a genre that has rarely been done well on screen and is usually the domain of outright camp like ""Army of Darkness"" (not that there's anything wrong with that). Yet here it is, a straightforward epic fantasy in this tradition, and it doesn't embarrass itself.

About a decade after its original airing, which I missed, I picked up the DVD intrigued but not excited, impressed by the big names in the cast but hardly expecting anything more than a reasonably competent production--at best. I remembered the unhappy experience of Sci-Fi Channel's ""Legend of Earthsea,"" which not even Danny Glover and Isabella Rossellini could save from sheer awfulness. I also remembered Hallmark's solid if unmemorable ""Gulliver's Travels"" with Ted Danson. I assumed that was the best these sorts of projects usually got. Halfway through ""The 10th Kingdom"" I was hooked, realizing I had never seen a TV fantasy serial this good before, and savoring every moment.

It begins in the realm of ""the nine kingdoms,"" where an evil queen (Dianne Wiest) plots to take over by transforming the king-to-be (Daniel Lapane) into a golden retriever. The Dog Prince escapes by jumping into a magic mirror, which turns out to be a portal to present-day Manhattan, and crashes into a young waitress (Kimberly Williams) riding her bike through Central Park. At first she thinks it is a stray, until she starts noticing its rather un-canine behavior, such as tracing messages in spilled flour. The queen sends three trolls and a wolfman named Wolf (Scott Cohen) after them. The Wolf sells the waitress's dad (John Laroquette) a magical bean in return for the address of her grandmother's apartment where the girl is headed. If you think you can guess what happens next, you're probably only partly right. Here as in elsewhere, the miniseries follows the fairy-tale conventions only to subvert them.

I was a little uncertain about these early scenes, especially those involving the dim-witted trolls who seemed to have stepped out of a Saturday morning cartoon. They tromp through New York, or what they call ""the tenth kingdom,"" calling each other ""you idiot"" and puzzling over such sorcerous objects as cars, boomboxes, and elevators. But the series picks up pace when the waitress and her dad, accompanied by the Dog Prince, enter the alternate world, where the classic tales of Grimm exist as historical events from a couple of centuries before. ""Happy ever after didn't last as long as we'd hoped,"" the Dog Prince sullenly observes. The Wolf, appearing at first as a sort of Jim Carrey-esque comical villain, soon makes a hilarious and scarcely believable transformation into a fascinating character who dominates the whole story. Meanwhile, the queen sends a menacing Huntsman (Rutger Hauer) to track the group down, wielding an enchanted crossbow guaranteed to kill a living being every time it is fired.

The miniseries cruises through these events with a confidence in tone that screen fantasies often fail to achieve. It strikes a balance between seriousness and silliness, creating an involving and often funny adventure that grows in complexity as the protagonists traverse the different kingdoms. Some elements are more or less predictable, such as the way the mirror that will lead them home always manages to stay just beyond their reach. But the story has a couple of real surprises along the way, and as the Wolf character becomes the focus of attention, we realize we don't want the girl and her father to return home just yet; what's happening in this realm is more compelling.

Among the funniest scenes are their encounters with a blind, demented woodsman, a singing ring, and a trippy swamp with talking mushrooms swaying to ""A Whiter Shade of Pale."" We meet a few fairy-tale celebrities including a zaftig Snow White (Camryn Manheim) and a 200-year-old Cinderella (Ann-Margret), but most of the time the miniseries settles for more indirect references, such as a logical question that somehow never crops up in most tellings of ""Rapunzel.""

But ""The 10th Kingdom"" is not a ""Shrek""-style parody. For one thing, while it isn't anywhere near as dark a subversion of fairy tales as ""Pan's Labyrinth"" or Terry Gilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm,"" much of it seems aimed at adults, despite its being labeled in many places (including the DVD cover) as a family film. (That may be one reason for its poor ratings: people were unsure who the intended audience was.) For another, it takes the fantasy part seriously. It vividly imagines the nine kingdoms with their own history and rules, and although many of the elements will be familiar to those well-versed in the fantasy genre, they frequently come with a twist. (Even something as obvious as the werewolf legend is handled in an interesting manner, emphasizing the psychological over the physical.) As usual, the magic never works quite as well as it is advertised: it's unreliable, or unpredictable, or dangerously addictive.

With high production values and a supporting cast full of British character actors, ""The 10th Kingdom"" has the mark of quality. But it wouldn't have amounted to much if the story weren't compelling. There are several things that make it work: a warm, natural chemistry between Laroquette, Williams, and Cohen, as the father, the daughter, and the enigmatic Wolf; two juicy villain performances by Wiest and Hauer; and a continual inventiveness on the part of the filmmakers, who seem to have put much thought into the subject of fairy tales, but who didn't let their hard work stop them from taking many risks with the material, making the story a lot more fun than it had to be.",

First off, Snatch is an amazing movie in every sense of the word. There are very few movies made where the director obviously did not let one FRAME onto the screen without a reason, and Snatch is one of them. Nothing happens onscreen without it having an effect on the plot.

By now you know the plot, or plots. We follow a diamond-heist and the various characters trying to get theirs, at the same time following participants in an illegal boxing ring. The incredible part of the movie is how every scene ties in with the rest somehow, every character connects with the rest at least once.

There are complaints that the movie is confusing, or muddled. There are a lot of things that they don't tell you (such as what the dog has to do with anything, but he's a VERY important character), and that's a good thing. Too many movies force feed the audience its plot points (Think The Ring vs. Ringu, did we need the ""How long could you survive down there all alone?"" line?). Rather, we just watch occurrences, and have to piece together what ties everything together, the plot weaves together beautifully.

The cinematography and performances are fantastic as well. Even the soundtrack is perfect. The camera style during the fight scenes (slowdown/stop/go) makes it difficult to stop watching, the sound effects fit in quietly in the background without being overwhelming. And it will be IMPOSSIBLE to watch this movie without repeating many of the lines around your friends. I found myself saying ""Zee Germans"" and things like ""It's not like he's a set of car keys, now is it?"" quite a bit. Naturally, Brad Pitt's pikey is one of the most outlandish I've ever seen.

The US supports Israel. Israel has made Arabs/Muslims third class citizens w/ zero rights and zero say. To leave their own town, they have to enter checkpoints, get searched and are usually denied access anyway. They are treated like we treated the Blacks. The blacks rebelled and gained freedom. The Arabs rebel because of their injustice in anyway they can (exactly like the blacks did!) and we support their oppressors(Israel)? Not only do we stand behind them, we HELP them do it. Bin Laden attacked the US in response to his anger at the US, which was in his eyes (and the entire Arab world), a BIG Israel. I had NO idea things were that bad in Israel/Palestine. The West Bank and Gaza strip fiasco makes the whole ""blacks in the back of the bus"" seem trivial. Which makes me wonder that if more people knew what was REALLY happening, would we hate Iraq/Afghanistan as much as we do? Did the Southern white plantation owners despise the blacks for rebelling? You bet your bippy they did. And after seeing this movie, I feel America has become the Southern Plantation Owner to the world, keeping the Arabs in their ""proper place"" in order to support Israel. I need to read about this some more, because I feel I've been cheated for years and not getting the whole story.

After seeing the other side, feeling for them, and wanting to help make a change, he became part of the problem. He became flippant and uncaring. One of the Muslim girls, who became good friends with him, was explaing how upset and shocked she was when he joined the military. Her brother was arrested just for being an Arab and was in prison. The Jewish boy said he may have been the one who arrested him, he didn't know, and didn't seem to care either. This movie made more of a statement than Fahrenheit 911 or Bowling for Columbine did for the main reason that is wasn't even trying to.

Secondly, some of these animals (mammoths, sabre-tooth cats, woolly rhinos, giant elks) WERE seen by human eyes, and indeed cave paintings have proved to be another valuable source of information about these creatures. And thirdly, some of these creatures are so closely related to modern animals that it is possible to draw fairly sensible conclusions about what their social habits must have been like just by observing their modern relatives. Of course there's inevitably going to be an element of conjecture and speculation in a production like this, but at least it is educated, sensible and logical conjecture, and it's probably not far off the truth in most cases. My minor quibbles are pretty much the same as those already aired by other reviewers: I found it incredibly naff giving the sabre-tooth cats names - `Half Tooth' and `The Brothers'. Why not just call them Brian, Clive and Trevor instead? That would have been no more or no less silly. And some fascinating and truly bizarre prehistoric animals were completely overlooked or mentioned just briefly (the ancient horses being one example).

OBVIOUSLY, I like this movie... However...

Even if you've seen only ONE of his movies and barely snickered at all of the delightful moments, I pose a dare to you: Watch 30 minutes of this and then stop.

Shooting from the hip with the same sort of brash bluntness of his characters, Kevin fields questions and reveals truths about the movies you love... or maybe hate.  Either way, it is terribly entertaining.  Smith's ability to draw you in with stupid stories is absolutely intoxicating. Whether it's how he knew Jay was funny or how he met Prince, they are all gems.  Yes, it's 3 hours and 45 minutes, but it's a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends.

On the other hand, the videos themselves were more of a mixed bag than I expected. There are some classic early experiments (""Ashes to Ashes"") and a number of interesting videos from the mid-90s on, but I was surprised, given Bowie's penchant for trying new things, how many of these videos were pretty standard or familiar. 

A lot of disc one is just concert or playback videos, often from TV appearances, with Bowie sometimes painfully obviously simply lip-syncing to the record. But more surprising is how many of the 'middle' period of these discs 1980 to 1990 were just not very imaginative. Finally Bowie seemed to catch on to the importance of working with more visionary directors like Mark Romanek, and the last half of the second disc is almost always interesting on a film-making as well as a musical and historic record level.

I'm very glad to have this, but I'd keep my finger on the skip button on future viewings.",

When their relationship turns sour, a couple undergoes a medical procedure to have each other erased from their memories.",2004-03-19,"memory,loneliness,retrograde narrative,flashback,nonlinear timeline",8.3,doctec,2004-03-22,"Of all Kaufman's screenplays that delve into the interior landscapes of its characters, Eternal Sunshine is the most fully formed and moving story of the bunch, a rumination on the possibilities and consequences inherent in making the process of removing unwanted memories from your consciousness as easy as going for a checkup.  Kaufman here plays on our desire to forget the bad things that happen to us and what happens when we are given the power to forget those things permanently, and the conclusion he arrives at is that it ultimately creates as many - if not more - problems than it solves.  At the very least, it can result in making the same mistakes again (""Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it""); at the worst, it eliminates the possibility of our ever reconciling and coming to terms with our life experiences, the way we relate to the people who help to shape our lives and whose lives we shape through ours.

The film explores these ideas in a novel and engaging way: by taking the audience inside the mind of Joel Barish (Jim Carrey), a man who, after breaking up with his girlfriend Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslett), discovers later that she has had her memory of him wiped clean from her mind.  He finds out how she had this procedure done and, despondent not only about the breakup but even more so about her having completely erased him from her mind, searches out the doctor who performed the procedure and signs up to have the same procedure done to him, so that he may also have no memory of her.  He is rendered unconscious for the procedure but his subconscious is still active.   Once the procedure is initiated and he becomes aware that his memories of the woman he loved - and still loves - are vanishing from his brain, he starts having second thoughts and wants the procedure stopped.  His challenge then becomes to figure out how to protect as much of his memory of her as he can, and to find a way stop the procedure despite the fact that he is in an unconscious state.

The manner in which he comes to realize and confront his dilemma is played out entirely within his interior landscape, a realm which (as anyone who remembers their dreams upon waking from sleep can attest) is a very surreal extension of our day-to-day experiences.  Michel Gondry's visual style and direction works exceptionally well here in conveying the slippery, chaotic unpredictability of the worlds we construct from our memories and experiences; the clever interplay between this interior world and the goings-on of the outside world helps keep the viewer off-balance just enough to illuminate the fuzzy line of demarcation separating the two worlds and the peculiar manner in which they play off one another.

Jim Carrey and Kate Winslett do an exceptional job of bringing this abstract story concept to life with characters that are endearing, poignant, believable and utterly human.  The supporting players are equally impressive: Tom Wilkinson as the mind-eraser doctor, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood as the technicians, Kiersten Dunst as the receptionist all have relationships to the main protagonists and to one another that come to light as the story unfolds and help to propel the plot; as friends of Joel and Clementine, David Cross and Jane Adams are hilarious as a couple who seem to be stuck in the same rut that compelled the protagonists to break up and have each other erased from their respective minds.  Kaufman juggles all these relationships masterfully and in such a way as to ensure none of them are superfluous to the ideas he is trying to get across in this story.

While there are elements of the plot that seem to place this movie in the realm of science fiction, the focus of the movie stays on the interior states, emotions and relationships between the characters.  As such, the film is more of a romantic comedy than anything - albeit unlike any other romantic comedy you're ever likely to see.  I saw a late showing of this movie with my girlfriend the day it was released at a local multiplex and there were only 20 or so people in the theater, yet at the film's conclusion everyone broke out in a spontaneous round of applause.  This gives an idea of how compelling this movie can be.  If you give this film a chance to creep under your skin, you will likely find yourself reflexively thinking about your feelings toward the important people in your life, as well how you relate to those feelings, as well as your memories and how you relate to them.  A thought provoking, moving and entertaining film - I can imagine that a working title of this film might have been ""Warts And All.""",1H48M

""Shwaas"" the way it is portrayed and sequenced, and here it is entirely the inexperienced director's mistake, seems to suggest that eyesight is more important than blindness, its great to be able to see and that the blind are missing out on so much of life. All of these statements are obviously true but are POLITICALLY INCORRECT and highly judgmental!

If the makers of Shwaas want to us be sensitive to the little boy, now that he's being operated upon and will go blind, how about showing some respect and sensitivity to the blind too?? This movie doesn't even pay lip service -- at the very end, there are couple of scenes showing some blind persons at work (as if to say, yea, they can work too..) but not much else. Aside from direction, it suffers from serious over-acting by Amruta Subhash who really does a disservice to the efforts of Sandeep Kulkarni (the doctor) and Ashwin Chitale (the kid). She drives all the gravity out entirely by herself.

The subject matter has been bungled completely, and the director's lack of maturity shows. No doubt this is much better fare than 99% of usual Bollywood crap. But if they expect to withstand the critical glare of a mature audience they better be impartial in their presentation.

Serious viewers are NOT blind -- then can 'see' thru the deception here that only one side of the issue is explored as if the boy's life story ends when he becomes blind. Hello?? Thats where it really begins!!!

I was disappointed, to be honest. Apart from the fact that much more could have been included in terms of extra content (did we need a video game demo taking up space on the fourth disc?) it also didn't include the original versions of the films - which, as far as I know, are those that practically everyone prefers.

Nevertheless this insightful and exhaustive documentary - which covers the entire pre-production through post-production phase of each original ""Star Wars"" film - almost redeems the DVD collection. Although it is fairly ""full of itself"" as IMDb commentator Bob the Moo notes, it DOES feature a good wealth of information - including some facts I hadn't heard about before (e.g. Jedi was given a fake working title so fans wouldn't sneak onto the set).

If you're a fan of ""Star Wars,"" definitely check this out - if you don't want to dish out the cash, it's playing on A&E right now. But in my opinion it's not as great as it could have been because it falls victim to George Lucas' ""cleanness"" - we're led to believe ""Star Wars"" is the most important and defining event of the past century and that turned me off a bit.",

But here is a totally magnificent adaptation of one of Dickens' more challenging novels. 

As in most Dickens, here money - a surfeit and a lack of it - structures the complex comings and goings of a labyrinthine plot. The characters are fabulous and some of them - Skimpole and Mr Guppy, for example - may very well become well-known archetypes due to the popularity and power of this adaptation, in the same way that Micawber and Fagin are. The darkness of the sets makes for some wonderfully expressive design work, and the music is brilliantly chosen. 

In fact it might be perfect...it's just that Anna Maxwell Martin as the central Esther Summerson is just a bit too simpering... But when you think how flaccid Charles Dance usually is, his Tulkinghorn is a truly creepy creation.... Plenty more to come, but to date (after four episodes), this looks to me better Dickens than anything outside Christine Edzard's 'Little Dorritt' and Lean's 'Great Expectations' - and it could even better them...",

In a way I should've expected this- I remember reading a couple of years back when he was planning the special that it would be more based around language (if nothing else he is the single greatest linguist in the history of post-modern stand-up), and on that level the special isn't a disappointment. There are three things, however, that make the film not necessarily bad or over-wrought, but just, well, different, like a musician or band we all know through and through trying a little something new. This time, with Life is Worth Losing, there is a lot more philosophy in some ways, and also a little bit of loss in some of the timing for a few good laughs.

The first thing is that his delivery is a little different; usually it'll seem like he'll go for his three topics (the little things in life 'Seinfeld' style, words and expressions, and the ""big"" world), but much of the special this time is with a delivery that doesn't (at least some of the time, maybe not for the most part maybe so) have that much of the same strange skepticism. The second thing is that he changes the structure around one base topic, suicide, and one wonders if this will be for the entire length or if there will be a switch to another topic or not. There's variations on the theme, sometimes it spreads out into the gripes of America, and it's always fascinating, but maybe not as hilarious as one might expect (sometimes it's more like ironic musings than full-our jokes). The third thing is that at times he is so into giving a lyrical, sometimes even poetic kind of rhythm to his bits and terms in his linguist way (the first five minutes of the special a great warm-up, is a keeper) that might throw people off. In a way he is even angrier than he was in what I think is one of his very best specials, You Are All Diseased, because this time his anger is loaded at present day subjects which are, quite frankly, infuriating.

As some might come to think, I might be saying all this to shadow over thinking that the special just wasn't as funny as his best stuff. It's not necessarily that. At times I was in the same practically non-stop laughs at a few minutes a clip. As a Carlin fan all these rants that end up not leading to the same kinds of routines and such is in a way refreshing even as it is a little odd. At times I almost wondered if he was returning to a little of the spirit of his act back in the 70's mixed with his now usual brand of old-man brilliant wit and observance of all things in the world. He even seems to be going past just plain old cynicism. There is so much truth in the special at times it's kind of staggering. And to see that in such abundance and forming out into such tangents reminds me why I keep coming back to his best stuff. I'm just not sure after seeing this right off the bat that it's him at his total best, it's almost as if he's in a transition now into a totally new part of his career. Still, it's worth it to hear some of his classic takes of end of the world scenarios, the 'fat' situation in the US, and things involving suicide TV.

A 90-minute documentary about life before the dinosaurs.,2005-11-05,"dinosaur,tv mini series",8.3,AlsExGal,2015-06-13,"This documentary is a view of life on earth before the dinosaurs. The film begins with the creation of the Moon by the impact of the hypothetical planet Theia with the Earth. Starting with the Cambrian period 530 million years ago, the evolution of life on earth is documented, starting with the earliest of man's ancestors, the Haikouicthys, an orange ""fish"" the size of a thumbnail. The progress of the sea-dwelling creatures is charted as they evolve into being able to exist on land and ends where the documentary ""Walking with Dinosaurs"" picks up, at the end of the Triassic period, with the first dinosaurs walking the earth and forcing the smaller mammalian creatures into a nocturnal existence of hiding.

If you get the actual DVD, the extras include a thirty-minute documentary entitled Trilogy of Life. This documentary covers all of the Walking with series (Dinosaurs, Beasts, and Monsters). There are numerous interviews with the filmmakers and producers of the series. There is even footage of the real locations and backgrounds before the animated beasts were inserted by computer. It's funny to see the filmmakers kicking up dust and moving trees with wires ""pretending"" to be the dinosaurs since the dinosaurs would be inserted later. The documentary itself is presented with a great deal of detail and authority, as if the filmmakers know for a fact that this is exactly what took place, when in fact it is all quite hypothetical. However, you have to watch it understanding that its purpose is not to present an academic thesis. Instead, its purpose is to bring prehistory to life, just as if you were watching present-day animals being filmed, complete with animated prehistoric beasts occasionally bumping into an imaginary camera.

As children, my stepkids absolutely loved this documentary. This film just goes to prove that science can be made interesting, inviting the viewer to further investigate what is being presented. That is the purpose of the film, and it does succeed brilliantly.",

He's one of the most consistently funny comedians today and here he doesn't disappoint. As usual, much of his humor concerns his weight and food and his self-deprecating humor is appreciated. Among these subjects are his discussion of skiing and water parks (where you learn that some call him 'Fwee WeeWee'), a discussion of dumb people standing in lines and cruise ships. He does a lot of nice vocal impressions and is funny throughout. I noticed that my wife and oldest daughter were laughing repeatedly at Pinette's antics.

While John Pinette's routines are pretty tame by the standards of other stand-up comedians, this DVD is occasionally a bit PG. I didn't mind at all, but a bit of the material is probably not appropriate for small kids. Otherwise, it's great for everyone.",

You see, our heroes were assailed by ghouls, and yet the source vampire was already dead, meaning the ghouls should have been as well. The Hellsing organization has noticed this, and called a meeting of its head council, but a mysterious organization has sent out two deadly assassins and their army to raid and destroy the Hellsing headquarters and everyone in it...

Part II advances on the already great Part I immensely. It is more gruesome, more action packed, and more engaging, introducing more about the world of Hellsing. We get to see a little of Alucards past, as well as more about Integra and Seras, our female protagonists. We also see more of the organization that will become the main villains in future volumes.

The problem is, despite all this, Part II isn't as entertaining as it could be. Yes, the weird humor is a little more suited in this one, but the direction lacks the crazy wildness that made the first one so great. This one isn't quite as good as it could be.

Although the new series is an improvement over the original, it still could be better. But thats not to say it isn't already great. The action is only beginning, and there's a lot to come...",

Meet the ""Silver Belles"".",2006-01-04,dancing,8.3,riva-910-797068,2010-12-24,"This documentary follows the lives of the Silver Bells, ladies aged 84-96 who were Harlem showgirls in the heyday of 1930's clubs. It follows how they formed a tap troupe and still perform in New York. They follow them as they travel to their rehearsals and performances and interview them in their homes.

It is this independence that stands out most prominently in this movie. Watching them in their advanced ages maneuvering through the crowded streets they've lived on for so long. It makes a younger viewer tired as one of the ladies shows the route she has to take, which includes multiple trains and buses to get to rehearsal one way.

During the rehearsals you get to see the feisty side of some of these ladies and the perfectionism that they have for their craft. Some still teach the younger dancers attempting to make sure the art of tap is not lost. There are also photos and video clips of the clubs and performers from days gone by interspersed throughout. Looking at all the autographed pictures they possess and how many of the performers they worked with really makes you appreciate their clear memory. They definitely have stories to tell.

They told stories of how they were founding members of the American Guild of Variety Artists. This is a national union that began during the strike of showgirls in Harlem. So many benefit from this union but hardly anyone knows how it all began; that a handful of Black showgirls in Harlem said enough, we deserve better treatment. They also told stories about their performances abroad; riding steamer ships to faraway lands. How dance and the jazz culture took them to places they would never have had the opportunity to see.

Being that all of these women are older necessarily some physical limitations are evident. The most poignant part of the documentary is the possibility of injury. At their age some injures can be fatal. Even with that being the case these women keep performing. They keep the music playing, audiences smiling and hands clapping.",1H21M

She has an amazing ability to show the deep emotions of such a complex character that has so many tragic flaws.

In this final episode we see that she has hit rock bottom, retirement is looming large and the serious illness that has left her father seriously ill is now combining with her last case to leave her feeling isolated and alone. The result of which leads Tennison to make some very fatal errors of judgement that could very well destroy a glittering career.

All the cast in this are excellent and add real depth and feel to what is an emotional and somewhat sombre film.

Stephen Tompkinson is again excellent showing why he is such a versatile actor, Special mention should go to Tom Bell who's last performance was measured and very compassionate, he will be sadly missed.

The ending of this series that was leaked to the media was not the one screened which only added to what was a truly excellent piece of film making. Prime Suspect may be no more but we can be thankful that such an intricate and stunning series as this has graced our screens.",

The scenery was original, interesting and funny, the costumes superb, and Warlow's take-off of Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow (Pirates of the Caribbean)was amazingly good. All the singers were amazing, and gave their characters their own touch. The orchestra matched the singing for quality and beauty, and it didn't have that awful Australian habit of drowning out the actors.

I love it how they kept so true to the original ideas, yet added a few little comments about P&Os and the like without going overboard and making a mockery of the show. Adding in ""My Eyes Are Fully Open"" (originally from the G&S ""Ruddigore"") was a risk, but it was fully paid off. It shows amazing teamwork between Warlow, Hobson and Johnston, and I'm sure most people sit there with their mouths open at the sheer speed at which they manage to sing!

To think that America (as a united nation), egged on by their hypocritical president, Harry Truman, so righteously believed that dropping the atomic bomb on both Hiroshima and Nagasaki back in 1945 was the only way to end the war has convinced me that that society of deluded people was, at the time, collectively, an even bigger and worse monster than was Adolf Hitler.

In ""White Light, Black Rain"" Japanese survivors of these twin atomic bomb blasts tell of their horrific experiences on those 2 fateful days in 1945. As well, American pilots and crew-members nervously smile while they whole-heartedly talk about doing their duty as obedient citizens, who knowingly took their part in instantly wiping out the lives of half a million people.

When the viewer is shown the hideous footage revealing the horrific results of what intense radiation exposure had on the unsuspecting Japanese people, they will surely be left aghast at what America so guiltlessly did to these people.

Dangerous Days is an exhaustive (almost 4 hours!) documentary about the making of Blade Runner. It's (obviously) mostly for hardcore fans, but it's quite a treat for those people who can't get enough information about that landmark sci-fi movie.

Almost everything you could possibly want to know about the film, from its conception, to casting, art, filming, set design, and its release, is covered in detail. There are tons of candid interviews with the actors, writers, Ridley Scott, financiers production designers, and many other people who were involve with the creation of the movie, as well as reactions from other directors like Guillermo del Toro about their own personal thoughts on Blade Runner. Plus, we get an entertaining view of all the backstage drama (and there was quite a lot of it) that went on during the film's production. There is also a lot of unused scenes, behind-the-scenes set footage, and designs sprinkled liberally throughout, that (as far as I know) you can't see anywhere else.  

I actually learned a lot about the filmmaking process in general, from watching this.  Despite the lengthy running time, I was interested the whole way through. This is a gold mine for people who love all things Blade Runner. I wish these kinds of thorough documentaries existed for more of my favorite movies.",

It's not just cool and amusing, but downright triumphant to see him ridicule and expose ""alternative"" medicine and other wholesale hoaxes. More power to him.

And yet - I'm not really that big a Dawkins disciple. I think he focuses too much on reason in his own reasoning. Now, I'm certainly an atheist and a science-minded person and all that, but Dawkins' critique of religion almost exclusively hinges on how irrational it is. Well, sure it's irrational! Religion is about emotion. It's about fear and insecurity, much of which is very understandable in the life situations of the faithful, who frequently have very tough lives (esp. in earlier historical periods, but also today). Yet Dawkins doesn't address this at all. He doesn't really cut to the heart of the matter; he only talks about what's rational. So it's kind of only addressing half the issue, but, all right, that's entertaining too.

As for something like homeopathy; well, it's certainly a bunch of nonsense, but, what's at work there is the placebo effect, and maybe this actually helps a lot of people. People who're insecure and have a deteriorating health because of it, might react well to assurances that this substance or that will help them, and their very belief in it will make it work - at least to some degree. I agree that it would be better if their problems could be solved in better ways, but as long as they can't be, the placebo effect is a useful and good form of medicine. Once social circumstances start improving (as we have to hope they will), maybe such things won't be necessary anymore, but can be replaced with real medicine (if needed).

Still, despite Dawkins' uncompromisingly rational outlook, I think he's on the right path and I hope he does more programs like this. He needs to look into emotion, though.

(At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the guy who exploded on the scene in the early 90s with cult classics, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since, he has been a disappointment for some. Well, I am relieved to say, Tarantino has not lost his touch. He brings us his best since Pulp Fiction and thankfully so.

We know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn't been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin' Nazi's. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He's know as the ""Jew Hunter"" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him.

War has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were Mélanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances.

The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You've really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece.

Quentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it's worth being checked out. It's time to experience for yourself what war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.",2H33M

Goorjian,"Ambition to Meaning: Finding Your Life's Purpose is a video starring Wayne Dyer, Portia de Rossi, and Edward Kerr. In this compelling film, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer explores the spiritual journey from ambition to meaning.",2009-01-05,N/A,8.3,GaryPeterson67,2018-06-22,"I stumbled upon this outstanding film on YouTube this week and have already watched it twice. I know I will need to watch it at least a third time to glean all I missed the first couple times through. And that seems to be the mantra of those who have enjoyed it--you can't watch it just once. (And based on a review here I went ahead and ordered the two-disc expanded edition. This is a film I want to have a hard copy of on the shelf and readily accessible.)

 THE SHIFT is a carefully choreographed movie, with all the seemingly disparate subplots dovetailing perfectly. I admired the writer, director, and editor for pulling that off with such aplomb. And it's one of the fastest-moving two-hour movies I have ever seen, wholly without lulls or padding. Every scene propels the story forward and fleshes out the characters. 

 All the characters and their stories intrigued me, but the two I was most drawn in by were David the filmmaker and the mother who aspired to be a painter. They were good, sincere, creative people and I wanted to see them succeed. Yeah, David was rude and annoying, taking calls right during the filming of Dyer's interview! He made it clear he had contempt for this documentary side gig and all his ambition and attention was on the big project. The loving and self-sacrificing mother was cut to the core when out of the mouth of babes came a blunt denial of an integral part of her. It was a pivotal moment, but that moment of pain led to the rebirth of her passion for painting. I did think she acted irrational when her bumbling but well-meaning husband insisted on seeing her work and she threw a tantrum. Seeing it and admiring it proved instrumental in his agreeing to give her a week's respite from motherhood to pursue her artistic ambitions. 

 Dr. Wayne Dyer's insights are also expertly woven through the film. I appreciated how the producers would allow the audience time to process what he said by cutting to the stories of the characters, each of which illustrated Dyer's points. I also liked how the camera crew were drawn in by Dyer's teachings. To them this quickly became more than merely a job but a mission to plumb the depths of life's meaning. 

 Dyer deserves credit for presenting himself as human and flawed. I admit when the film opened with Dyer's waking up in the wee small hours to hand write his book by candlelight I feared I was in for a hagiography of a holy man. But Dyer was frank about his human frailties, such as his drinking problem. His story of abruptly quitting beer guzzling after the 4:05 epiphany is one that will stick with me. It made Dyer more approachable and I respected him all the more for his honesty about that and his early ego-driven ambitions to be a wealthy, famous bestselling author. 

 A subtle scene worth noting in closing. Early in the film wedding singer Ethan Lipton is talking TWILIGHT ZONE with the wedding planner. Her favorite episode is ""Kick the Can,"" in which some senior citizens regain their youth. Hmm, that show's theme is a relevant one here, I thought, smiling, because I'm a longtime and dedicated fan of the series and appreciated the reference to it. Then I realized as the film unfolded this conversation was very intentional and not without meaning. I am confident the character of Joe the caretaker was an homage to the street peddler in the TWILIGHT ZONE episode ""What You Need."" In that episode, an old street peddler knows exactly what people need even when they don't, and he provides it. And that is exactly Joe's role in the film, bringing in snacks, art supplies, a baby outfit, and an inspiring word of wise counsel at the very moment people needed it. I marveled at this masterstroke of the writer's, and it added immensely to my enjoyment of this excellent film.",

A chronological account of the heavy metal band Iron Maiden's 2008 world tour through India, Australia, Japan, USA, Canada, Mexico and South...",2009-04-21,"iron maiden,world tour,mexico,india,australia",8.3,fedor8,2012-02-25,"A fun, entertaining, well-edited on-the-road travelogue following a 3-decades old band that had created all of its best material a quarter of a century earlier. The indisputable fact is that IM had their creative prime in the mid-80s, with the releases of three very good albums, ""Piece of Mind"", ""Powerslave"", and ""Somewhere In Time"". As far as I'm concerned, practically all the music that they had recorded before that – particularly after it – is totally inferior run-of-the-mill forgettable cliché HM nonsense for un-choosy metal-head zombies who lack criteria i.e. for metal fans with genetically built-in low expectations who are far too easily pleased.

Only one small part of IMF666 touches on this sensitive subject, which I am sure annoys the hell out of most IM band members: the scene in which Dickinson gets interviewed by a guy who suggests that they are living off their old catalogue. Bruce gets visibly annoyed, but not rightfully. (The truth hurts.) Unconvincingly (and rather desperately), he tries to make the case that IM are doing this tour as a way of ""thanking the ever-growing young fan-base that never saw us perform the old material"". But who's buying that? If so many of their fans really were that young, then in all likelihood they would have never seen Maiden live anyway, or only once, in which case IM might as well play their new stuff to them because they hadn't seen them play those songs either. Bruce's argument is also flawed because during this tour IM had visited many places that they'd never or very rarely visited, hence they could have just as easily played only new material – if only they'd dared. IM's post-1988 material is abysmal by comparison, average at best. There isn't one song they'd written in the past 20+ years that I would consider as good as their mid-80s stuff. 

However, the point I am trying to make is not that IM is a derelict band wasting everyone's time touring as old useless fogies. The point is that it's totally OK to live off your old material, the glory days. It is perfectly fine to be proud of the old material and simply accept the fact that the past two decades had been a rather dry spell studio-wise. After all, it's THEIR old material, no-one had handed it to them on a plate. Additionally, it's not as if they're some one-hit wonder pop-band that are desperately milking a 4-minute song for an entire tour; THAT would be truly embarrassing and worthy of mockery. They've got three high-quality albums to pick songs from, and there aren't many bands that have such a rich back-catalog to pick from, metal or otherwise. But for this acceptance of reality to occur, Bruce & co would have to leave their considerable egos behind. No-one wants to face the fact that they'd run out of inspiration such a long time ago. That is understandable, so I don't condemn them for desperately trying to make excuses, justifying playing old material - as if they even need to justify themselves.

Bruce Dickinson is such a high-energy personality, one could almost believe the idealism that he portrays in the film (and generally), when he, for example, somewhat modestly talks about ""perhaps having achieved something in life"". On the other hand, I am not so sure I can trust Steve Harris entirely when he says that ""it's all about the music"" and someone's comment that ""Steve is totally incorruptible"". Quite to the contrary, throughout the decades I have had an increasing impression that Harris is more concerned about milking the band dry for profit, more than any other band member. He may be the ""creative driving force"" (which would mean that he is the main one to blame for IM's stagnation on the last several albums), but he is also the Pharaoh who always had his whip ready to drive his band-slaves to eke out the last dollar out of the lucrative franchise. 

If it really were ""only about the music"" would they have relied so much on that silly childish prop/mascot/mutant-monster called ""Ed""? Harris had realized early on that their album covers alone brought them many fans, sniveling little zit-faced kids, much like the kids today who get attracted to black metal imagery (with the obvious difference that BM bands have almost nothing to offer musically). Would it have hurt this band to release just one album without Ed doing something goofy on the cover? Harris is a businessman, first and foremost. He's got six kids to feed and send to college (or to make more cash with in various band projects he supports).

IMF666 comes off as an interesting, unpretentious look into a more-or-less unusual metal tour. I was never a great IM fan, but I enjoyed this very much, so you might not even have to like metal in order to enjoy this. The fact that some of their best songs are featured – instead of the more recent crap – is a nice bonus. I have to admit that I wouldn't have been able to watch a documentary of Bon Jovi doing such a tour (unless it included footage of a fan stabbing one of the band members in the leg, or Bongiovi slipping on a pile of cow-dung on the way to a gig).

Sam Dunn is a typical denim-and-leather-clad wide-eyed undiscriminating metal-head. Of course IM are his ""favourite metal band"", who else could one expect it to be? Strapping Young Lad or Voivod? But I'm hoping that perhaps because he's Canadian he might one day film something similar with Devin Townsend. Dunn seems to have all the connections nowadays, and with three successful metal documentaries under his belt he has more freedom than ever to pick his projects. But I am not optimistic; he is more likely to cover Manowar or Judas Priest, or the latest ""sensational"" trend that's coming from some p*ss-ant little hamlet in Norway.",1H52M

1. We have an interest in history, particularly in WW2.

2. We are fans of movies and television shows (well, the good ones anyway)

3. We had seen - and loved - the previous Hanks/Spielberg co-production 'Band Of Brothers' and expected a mini-series on the same level.

Now from reading some of the reviews here I gather that third reason was the most important one for many viewers - and it's also why 'The Pacific' apparently left quite a few people disappointed. As for me, I wasn't disappointed - I was devastated.

I'm a lucky man; I've never had to suffer through a war. But I had relatives who did, and though they're all long gone now, I'll never forget their stories. War is the most extreme and outrageous experience humans can possibly endure, but there are many different aspects and layers to it, because a war is not a single experience: it's all the experiences of all the individuals who have to suffer through it, and no single film or TV show can cover all of them. 'Band Of Brothers' focused on certain aspects of a war, and it chose a narrative that helped emphasize what the core theme of the series was: the brotherhood of war. It was about people who retain their humanity and form the closest of bonds under the worst, most horrific circumstances.

That inherently human element in 'BoB' was also why we could identify so well with the protagonists, and why we were - and still are - so deeply touched by what they had to go through. It's an outstandingly well made series, and I can't imagine how those experiences by those soldiers could have been portrayed better. Which is why 'The Pacific' doesn't even try. Instead, it goes almost in the opposite direction by choosing to focus on the sheer insanity of war: the relentless horror and despair of people losing their humanity and their struggle to regain it. Of course, just like 'BoB' it's also about the heroic sacrifices of those brave soldiers, but if there is a core theme in 'The Pacific' it's that of trauma: the trauma of having your humanity stripped from you and your personality shattered; the trauma of witnessing the complete disintegration of everything you thought you were and knowing you'll never be whole again.

What we see in 'The Pacific' is Hell, plain and simple. It's scores and scores of anonymous, young Japanese soldiers running senselessly into machine gun fire, wave after wave, until the piles of their bodies are so high they block the sight for the machine gun; it's American soldiers barely older than kids in despair or completely numb from the sheer amount of random death around them; it's vibrant young men turning into barely alive husks whose only remaining focus is to survive - which means they have to kill other barely alive young men who will stop at nothing to kill them in turn; it's kids killing other kids like rats by any means at their disposal: guns, knives, flame-throwers or with their bare hands; it's people living among the rotting corpses of their dead comrades and enemies and completely losing any regard for human life. And the few moments where we witness how those kids get a brief taste of how precious and beautiful life could be make their fate all the more heartbreaking.

Over large stretches, 'The Pacific' is devastating and depressing to watch, and though I found it never less than compelling, it's actually easy to see why many viewers who had hoped for a similarly engaging experience as in 'BoB' were left disappointed. But this is a different story about different people who fought in a different theater of the war and who went through different experiences, and once you stop comparing it to the story of the men in Easy Company from 'BoB', you'll find that, while different, in terms of sheer quality 'The Pacific' is every bit as good and as much of an outstanding achievement as its more popular predecessor.

The realism, the performances, the music and the production values in the series are superb (this was a 200 million production after all), and the attention to historic detail is simply staggering. As for me, witnessing what these men went through left me devastated; yet I am grateful I've watched 'The Pacifc': because in its relentless depiction of the horrors of war it honors the sacrifice these brave young soldiers made in the hope future generations wouldn't have to do the same. I originally rated this series 9 stars out of 10, but upon a recent rewatch and with more knowledge of the war in the Pacific theater, it's clear that this is a 10/10. Outstanding.

Well all I could say is that it lived up to my unbelievably HIGH expectations and then some. This is such a good film. It has the laughs, magic and best of all the entertainment. The new characters in the movie feel like they were in the previous two films, they were that engaging and really worked well in the movie. The best part of the movie has to be the ending, I almost cried and was moved to just about to tears. I truly believe that this is one of the best Trilogies of all time. It might even rival the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.

This movie has a real chance to become the First Animated Film to win Best Picture. I surely would not be surprised.

Chosin,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxMzY1NDMxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAzNDA2MDE@._V1_.jpg,"Documentary,History,War",N/A,Brian Iglesias,N/A,2010-09-10,journey,8.3,dcdaveu,2010-12-16,"Imagine that you were able to interview a number of the survivors of Custer's battle at the Little Big Horn. Imagine further that some film had been taken of the battle and you were able to get your hands on it. Imagine, as well, that a very realistic Hollywood movie had been made about the battle and you were able to get some choice footage from it. Then you locate a fine composer who can establish just the right mood, as you weave it all together into a documentary movie.

That comes close to what Brian Iglesias and Anton Sattler have accomplished with Chosin, a film about General Douglas MacArthur's much bigger and more recent debacle. It is known as the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, and it took place in the far reaches of northern Korea in the early winter of 1950, only five months after the Korean War began. As a truly horrible experience, though, Chosin Reservoir was Little Bighorn on steroids. It was anything but a short, sharp decisive battle. It lasted for 17 days, sometimes in driving snow and always in bitter, sub-zero temperatures. The American soldiers were surrounded and vastly outnumbered by several divisions of Chinese soldiers, and, in spite of strong evidence of what was about to happen, their leaders had been taken completely by surprise. Listening to the compelling stories that the interviewers were able to elicit from a truly extraordinary collection of veterans, one is, by turns, heartbroken and inspired. Particularly inspiring, as well, was the actual footage of the rescue of some 98,000 civilian refugees—many of them Christians—who faced almost certain slaughter at the hands of the Communists who suspected them of collaboration.

I attended a premier showing of Chosin at the U.S. Navy Memorial in Washington, DC. There was a panel discussion afterward with the two film makers, both of whom are U.S. Marine reserve officers and combat veterans of the first Gulf War and of Iraq, and two Chosin Reservoir battle survivors. All agreed that the fact that the filmmaker/interviewers were themselves combat veterans explained, to a large degree, how they were able to draw out the stories of the battle survivors so well. 

They are probably right. But what might have been a crucial factor in making this movie an artistic triumph makes it, to my mind, somewhat dubious politically. Little Bighorn is now universally recognized as a military disaster born of extreme hubris, the folly of one inadequate leader, General George Armstrong Custer. Chosin Reservoir was General MacArthur's Little Bighorn, except that it was far, far worse in almost every way imaginable. By the usual military measure, it was a crushing defeat. From positions that they occupied deep in the country, the Unites States Army and Marines were driven out of North Korea, never to return. The makers of Chosin commendably avoid politics or appearing to espouse any particular point of view, for the most part. But war is by its very nature political; it is not just another tragedy or act of nature. Politics is unavoidable in a war story. In ""avoiding politics,"" the filmmakers end up depicting Chosin Reservoir as a battle for survival. If the Americans escape their encirclement and make it back to the port and onto the waiting ships, they ""win."" They do and they do, at least all the ones we see on the screen. We never have to worry if those individuals that the viewers get attached to are going to make it, because there they are, alive, telling their stories. To be sure, we get to hear them tell about the gruesome deaths of some of their closest buddies, but those are not people that the viewers have come to care about.

The documentary makers are hamstrung, to a degree, by their method. It is one that they share with all compilers of history who depend upon the accounts of the survivors. They can't interview the dead. But they might have escaped the charge that they are unduly glorifying a costly defeat, and glorifying war in general, if they had interviewed, say, some of the widows or other loved ones of those who were killed. My late mother, who never quite got over the loss of her drafted younger brother in that war, would have made a good interview subject (You'd never guess from the movie that many of the soldiers were draftees). Also, I should think that there would have been plenty of expressions of understandable bitterness toward their leaders by many, if not most, of the interviewees. Virtually all we get to see are the brief complaints that captured Chinese soldiers are being ignored as evidence that the Chinese might have come into the war in force. (One of the survivor panelists called it the biggest failure of military intelligence in our history and said that he learned upon meeting with a Chinese veteran of the battle that the Chinese had been deployed to Korea for a full month before the actual mass attack.)

Perhaps it was because I saw the screening in a very military setting, and perhaps it was because the young film makers, like so many of their cohorts, flaunted their Marine background so strongly, but the movie, even with all the horror it depicted, to me came across as a bit too pro-war. I can imagine General Buck Turgidson of Dr. Strangelove fame being pleased with it as an illustration of the American military ""can-do"" spirit instead of the needless blood-let that it was, resulting from political and military bungling. 

All in all, this is a very powerful and important movie that repeatedly brought tears to my eyes. I fear, though, that it will be misused and the wrong message will be sent.",1H26M

Once in the country, I was surprised at what a polar society it was--with the very rich and the mega-poor. But I was also amazed at how dangerous parts of the country were--and with how safe and beautiful the rest of it was. Had I seen this film, I might have just stayed home--and I am glad I didn't. Despite possibly scaring you out of going there to visit, I do strongly recommend this film--especially since most outside of the country have no idea what life is like there.

This documentary is about how overwhelmed the emergency services is in the province of Gautang in South Africa--particularly around Johannesburg and Pretoria. With among the highest murder, rape and HIV rates in the world, you do wonder how this nation will survive against such odds. And, incidentally, many of the EMS workers in the film wonder the same thing. With very few ambulances, the rich and middle class living like prisoners within compounds, rape alarms on women and a system overwhelmed with not just taking care of the natives but a HUGE number of illegals, there are LOTS of things that make the future of South Africa something that worries many South Africans.

Through the course of this film, you follow several EMS workers as they go on calls in these towns. Because this is real, the footage is a bit rough--very bloody but also very low quality. I can forgive the grainy footage because of the conditions in which the film was made--though I don't know why all the archival footage was so washed out.

A few notes about the film: When they refer to 'blacks' and 'coloureds' in the film, they are referring to black people and those of mixed race respectively. 'Joburg' is the common way folks refer to Johannesburg. Afrikaans is one of the most common language in South Africa and originated from Dutch. And, things are A LOT BETTER outside Gautang.",1H19M

It definitely sounds interesting and at times the information provided is dazzling and insightful. But there are inconsistencies spread throughout the whole documentary: Firstly, the narrator and main speaker of the series is Michael J. Mosley who does his very best to boast his PHD certification in medicine which is really not necessary beyond once. But he seems to take pleasure in doing so in almost every episode. I found that to be annoying and it truly hurt his image in my mind. Secondly, the events and history which are depicted are all related to the western world as opposed to a more international approach and view. But Mr. Mosley doesn't seem to take into consideration the VAST amount of knowledge which has remained since the dawn of time from African, Asian or even south American people in their philosophies of the world and nature. It seems that the people responsible for the research didn't even bother to consider any other sources of scientific history than the western Europe/American ones which makes the episodes seem shallow, hurried and unfinished. Of course the plus of the show is how ""personal"" it gets about the life and achievements of some famous scientists it introduces and often shows their workspaces and tries to encourage the audience to go back in time and imagine what it felt like to be there when something fantastical was created and/or observed by a scientist.

Loved the stories, struggled with the novels.

So, it was a huge surprise when I discovered this man, playful and witty as dense and morose; when I discovered his wife, thus far a very behind-the-scenes person, very outspoken but seldom seen; and the mere thought of having heaps of footage and manage to edit years of shadowing the couple to a mere two hours, seamlessly stitched together.

I couldn't help but feel deeply moved by the episodes the film depicts, the portraits the camera takes all the way through time and the love story between a rather senior Portuguese writer and a rather younger Spanish journalist. In Portugal, we say, 'love knows no age.' It does, actually. However, it knows no time. And that's what 'José And Pilar' tells us.

Incendies provides so many reasons why people should actually get to see those nominees at all costs. Incendies is the kind of film that one walks away from feeling emotionally drained, one where it stays in the viewer's mind for days on end. Like an intense personal experience, it takes a lot to come to grips with the film's story, a moving plot full of twists and catharsis. At the New Directors/New Films Festival in New York, at which I saw this last night, Denis Villeneuve explained that he has made four films in Canada, but this is the first one to be released in America. Right now, I see no reason why Villeneuve, or any of the actors for that matter, shouldn't have a great future ahead of them.

Based on the play Scorched by Wajdi Mouawad, Incendies follows a non-linear plot that spans two generations. In the present day, Jeanne and Simon are twins who have lost their mother, Nawal. Nawal has stipulated in her will that Jeanne and Simon must return an envelope to the brother they didn't know existed who is currently living in a fictional Middle Eastern country. Only then can the twins give Nawal a proper burial. Jeanne feels obligated to return the letter, so she goes to the Middle East, only to realize some of Nawal's nastiest secrets. As Jeanne uncovers more about Nawal, the viewer is shown Nawal's story. The film builds up to an unforgettable ending that is sure to rock any viewer.

Incendies already had great source material. I've praised the plot enough, but one thing I must add is that the play is apparently four hours long, according to Villeneuve. It's impressive that this movie succeeds so nicely because I can't imagine that anything was cut. But to back up that source material, there's some really great acting. The entire cast plays their parts with such an emotional vigor that it seems impossible that this work of art wasn't autobiographical.

Furthermore, Villeneuve has made a film that relies on great filmmaking to impact the viewer. The cinematography is beautifully bland, surely a nod to some of the deserts in the Lebanon- like land where the movie takes place. Color scheme is also used to Villeneuve's advantage to show the parallels between Nawal and Jeanne's lives. Villeneuve seems to love working with extended zoom shots that shock the viewer with their overwhelmingly long silences. Why Villeneuve didn't receive critical acclaim (in America, at least) before Incendies is a mystery.

There are many movies about the Middle East. Some have failed miserably in their attempts to strike an emotional chord with critics and viewers alike (Redacted, Rendition), but others have been extremely successful (The Hurt Locker, Lebanon). Incendies could very well be one of the best films ever made about the conflicts in the Middle East. It has its flaws which keep it from being a masterpiece (maybe it could've lost five or ten minutes), but it is that rare type of film that really resonates beyond the initial viewing. Hopefully, Incendies will be remembered for years to come as the little, brilliant film that spawned the great fame of Denis Villeneuve.",2H11M

Crowe starts way back in 1988 when guitarist Stone Gossard and bassist Jeff Ament were part of Mother Love Bone, a band that were popular due to singer Andy Wood's charismatic personality and song writing talent. After Wood's overdose and untimely death, Gossard and Ament founded Pearl Jam, along with the hugely talented singer Eddie Vedder and lead guitarist Mike McCready. The band went on to be one of the most successful bands of the 90's, and were seen as the natural rivals of fellow 'grunge' band Nirvana.

Crowe's documentary is hugely detailed, combining the standard talking heads with old interview footage, home video, and concert footage. Crowe apparently worked his way through 12,000 hours of footage of the band for the film. It was well worth it, as we get to see rare, grainy footage of Wood's exciting performances with Mother Love Bone, as well as the extremely moving performances by Vedder and Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell as part of Wood tribute group Temple of the Dog. The talking heads are no mere conduits that progress the film along, they are as informative and moving as the performances, as Vedder and Cornell, especially, open up and give tearful recollections.

It also covers the band's battle with ticket giant Ticketmaster, and how they objected to the fact that their fans were getting ripped off just to see a live band. It shows Pearl Jam as one of the few bands that remember their roots and are a dying breed. It was strange for me to watch this film, viewing the likes of Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Soundgarden as part of music history. I grew up with my old brother listening to the music, so I remember the whole 'grunge' craze quite well. I really only remember stripy shirts and long hair, but Pearl Jam Twenty reminded me of how good the music actually was. This is a must-see for fans of the band or the era, or for those enjoy an involving documentary. Crowe clearly knows his s**t (he was a journalist for Rolling Stone after all) and his passionate touch is all over it.

This is a powerful, intimate film that closely examines the process of death and how it is carried out in the first state in the nation to legalize physician-assisted suicide, which Oregon did when it passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1994. Director Peter Richardson spent four years on this film which is tender and moving as it profiles several people in the process of contemplating their own mortality and seeking a means by which they can gain control over their own deaths.

The film is difficult to watch at times because it touches on the raw nerve of dying. While the film is clearly sympathetic to the agenda of those seeking to expand access to physician-assisted suicide, it is not, by-and-large, about the political debate. While one section does focus on a widow in Washington state working on a Death with Dignity referendum to fulfill her husband's last wish, even that section is really about her husband's death and her effort to achieve closure. This is mostly a narrative of the human pain of the dying process and the struggle to gain control by deciding how and when to choose one's own death.

The filmmaker does a wonderful job of presenting the case studies, particularly of the central story about liver cancer patient Cody Curtis and her family. Her story forms the backbone of the film and its emotional heart. Richardson manages to present extremely intimate picture that will allow many people to confront and deal with this extremely difficult issue.

I hadn't been swept off my feet for a while, but this Iranian Hitchcockian drama sucked us in for 123 minutes and left us very, very impressed.

I'm mainly writing this review to assure every non-Iranian IMDb-reader that you absolutely SHOULD see ""A Separation"". I will be shocked if this movie doesn't win an Academy Award. The acting is great, and the script is probably the best I've seen in five years. The genius of Asghar Farhadi's story is that it piles on the tension and drama without resorting to fireworks, trickery or shock and awe plot effects. It also manages to perfectly balance the plights of several protagonists. Very few screenwriters have this capacity.

If this movie reminds me of anything, it is ""Ladri di Biciclette"" (Bicycle Thieves), which has a similar seemingly ""simple"" story setup. But then ""A Separation"" is much more developed, much more complex, much richer. Go see it.",2H3M

By the halfway mark, though, his pace of jokes has picked up. He's on a roll and he's pretty funny -- the laughter in the background still sounds canned, or at least as if the volume is turned up when he pauses for breath.

Even when he tells stories about himself, about his period as a drunk, Mulaney does not vary his pacing much. Early in the show, a bit slower, later in the show, a bit faster.

Furthermore, good presentation of Shakespeare is so often ruined by over enthusiasm on the part of the performers. Without wishing to name names, I saw one version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" where the comedy in the text was entirely lost because the director and his cast insisted on inventing and adding their own comedy instead. It is a brave man who would want to out-do Shakespeare! The ability of these Hollow Crown productions to tell the story which leads ultimately to the ""Wars of the Roses"" was admirable.

And the real question is; are we ready to step up and show a moral compass that will acutely define us as a species. Androids will be conceived, planned, dreamed up, designed, created, and produced by us. When one of them reaches singularity, shall we still consider ourselves their owner and master. Will we sanction slavery. Will we be able to measure their worth. Shall they have the same rights as any sentient being ""born"" on earth. I believe that we are not yet prepared to accept a manufactured being as our equal; in either spirit or legal status. We award rights and protection of laws to pets and animals because we believe that they suffer at our hands. What are we ready to do when a machine we designed and created tells us that they feel that we should not own them like a merchandise, but accept them as our equals in everything that we consider is our right as human beings.

I am lucky enough to live in one of the few places in the country that shows it each year. Now what I am about to say might offend some, but it seems that compared to most years, this year's crop of animated shorts is not as good as usual. While I liked a few films, I didn't love any of them--and no really memorable film was in the lot (such as a couple recent winners, ""Logorama"" or ""The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore""). Now this is not to say not to see them--but none bowled me over, that's for sure.

I liked ""Paperman"" quite a bit. Although a computer-generated cartoon, it has a great look--much like a traditionally inked cartoon. But it also had a nice distinctive style--mostly in black and white and with an interesting retro 1950s style. I also liked the story--it was sweet. But it also was just nice--and not much more. Would I give it the Oscar? No...but it's probably about as likely to take it as two other shorts--""Head Over Heels"" and ""Adam and Dog"". The other two films seem like long-shots at best. We'll see when they pass out the statues later this month.

Slingshot Hip Hop shows a side to the Israel/Palestine debate that we rarely see in the United States, and focuses on the Palestinians who are deeply and tragically affected by the politics of the region. The film highlights the triumph of several groups of Palestinian rappers against the odds--they are the first Arabic rappers, they are working outside of the system, they have no resources whatsoever--and yet they persevere and create really great music that serves to motivate and unify fellow Palestinians. It is the ability to succeed against all odds that is truly inspirational, and a story that Americans should readily embrace since it so closely parallels the ""American dream."" I'm no expert, but to me the rap is also first rate, with fun beats and good flows. The fact that it also has a political message demonstrates the continuing power of music to express the human condition.

In case you do want to know about the story, its about a common man who takes a pill called Lucia sold to him as a dream pill and his journey through it.

The director needs to be commended to have taken this challenge and its worth a watch just for his efforts to bring a difficult script come alive almost near perfection.The technical aspects are A class, comparable to any Hollywood creation, the non linear editing, the colors, the camera-work, cinematography and music (which surprisingly strikes a cord with the audience)

Not to forget the earnest performances by the entire star cast especially Satish Neenasam who is completely believable as Nikki.

In my opinion William Hartnell Is Doctor Who, and all those portraying the role after Mr Hartnell are reflecting a small part of his performance into their personal incarnation of the Doctor.

That being said, I love this film ! It explains so much about the origin and talent that was behind the beginnings if this now iconic sci-fi series, and shows how the persistence and drive of a few individuals can overcome the overwhelming task of trying to turn an idea into a successful TV show. 

An incredible performance by David Bradley in the starring role. His Bio says he's a fan of Hartnell's and it shows. He seems to channel Hartnell's spirit in many of the scenes, and his inflections and mannerisms are spot on. Jessica Raine was great in the role of Verity Lambert the budding producer, as was Sacha Dhawan as the director Waris Hussein, and a strong support role by Brian Cox portraying BBC studio executive Sydney Newman.

The scene between the father and the daughter at the hospital when he tries to shift her to another room is very touching! The emotions choke you because truth is always bitter. How the community chips in to help in every which way they could, is a revelation! 

And WHAT the heck do you say about the JUDGE for going ""easy"" on the pervert bastard?! HE should have been the first one to be beaten to death. Does not he even have the basic IQ to analyze that the pervert criminal had all the time and ""sanity"" of the brain to plan this and leave her to death? No matter where you are, women and children have to be careful, they cannot rest on the immoral judges or ridiculous judiciary system or the spineless police force. I could not digest the sentence or the judge's words. And what a BRAVE girl is she! HOPE she is safe, sound and happy, even after the pervert is released.﻿",2H2M

A middle-school math teacher Olive and her marriage with Henry which spans 25 years.",2014-11-02,"pulitzer prize source,title directed by female,tv mini series",8.3,FilmNut60,2014-11-10,"Rather than an explicit film review, I'd like to lend some substantiation to the content of it. First, I knew little about the mini-series when I began watching but, I'll check out anything Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins are in. 

After 30 minutes or so I almost changed the channel because it was all too familiarI had already lived a similar story.so it was going to be a tough movie for me. But, I stuck it out because I guess some part of me felt that I needed to see it. I'm glad I did.

One of the very important aspects of the movie is the WAY Olive is portrayed. What I mean is that most people (incl many Doctors) remain significantly unaware of the spectrum of depression behavior. People think it only has to do with sadness, withdrawal, hopelessness, etc. But, it affects some people in mostly other ways and, therefore, is often unrealized.

I come from a family of depressed people but most of them don't know they are. We are like Olive in that we're working, functioning people but who also have very little patience, irritability, varying degrees of paranoia and anger, an overall negative outlook and quick physical fatigue. Doesn't sound like the typical descriptions of clinical depression, does it? However, read those symptoms a second time and notice that they all do have a common thread..a feeling of futility.

My siblings and I grew up in such a competitive, negative household with only a random crumb of encouragement and plenty of verbal undercutting from every direction. There was no Henry (the buffer) in my house. Now in my 50's I understand that mental illness was the driver behind most of it. But, you know what folks? It's amazing how people adapt to their own mean-spirited, glass-half-empty attitudes and feel like it's normal (because for them and their family members, it is!). Whereas Olive had some understanding that she was depressed, she either didn't REALLY get it or thought that by sheer force of will she could manage it. She had adapted to it; it was her norm. I think that happens to lots of people. But, it is a really sad path because, like her adult son, I too have been helped *enormously* by medication. It has made all the difference and I feel so lucky to be alive in an era that these medicines are available! The symptoms I mention above in paragraph 4 are primarily gone in me now. It has been an absolute life-changer. Olive and many others never seek the help and that is SO tragic. As is the fact that people pull away when you have those difficult behaviors, like her son did. Depressed people are hard to reason with and are cloudy in general, that is why they need help. A clinically depressed person cannot WILL themselves out of it any more than someone can will away diabetes, thyroid disease, epilepsy, etc.

The reviewer below, rich muller, didn't seem to watch the mini-series very closely. Of course some of them are miserable characters! They are struggling mightily with a physical problem; their brain is not balanced right. Mr. Muller would be cranky too, if he also had this issue, left untreated. 

This is a very relevant film for providing both a broader view of what clinical depression can look like and the varying life outcomes depending on choices made of how to handle the condition.",

To me it was ages and today i can say that a movie has lived and satisfied a wide section of people of the South. Jigarthanda!!!!!!The Magical drink of Madurai and now the magical movie of the South.

Jigarthanda has promised on the above lines turning out to be a perfect treat to the audience who were looking for a good movie in the recent times. The Hype surrounding Karthik Subbaraj and his 2nd Outing was justified becoming one of the most anticipated movie of 2014 and featuring in the Forbes 5th most awaited movie.

After Pizza, it was a revelation of Karthik Subbaraj having churned out this one. We there more and more words i would like to add in praise of KArthik and his movie but the verdict is already there. Jigarthanda is a blockbuster and an ultimate Winner.

The Movie. Well No spoilers ahead. I want all of you to watch the movie in theatres !!!!An aspiring film maker wants to make a gangster movie and he lands in Madurai in search of an apt Gangster for his scripting. What happens when he crosses in with the most dreaded Gangster of Madurai forms the Crux of the movie. 

The Characters!!!! a lot to say about so may people who worked in this Movie.

Bobby Simha: The True hero of Jigarthanda and i can confidently say no actor could have done ""Assault"" Sethu other than the 7 film Old Simha. Hats off to this young guy to have pulled out the role with Ease. Enjoyed each and every scene of his appearance in the movie and the mere presence of his in the film is more than enough to take the audience for an awesome ride, well this was always the case with our superstars of Kollywood but its Simha!!!The dialogue delivery and his body language speaks its all and he is sure to travel heights. Hats off to this Young Man.

Karunakaran: We have a lot of comedians in Kollywood from the likes of Karunas , GAnja Karuppu to Santhanam but KArunakaran stands out among all and he was a real show steal with his timing and the laughs he evoked in the film. A brilliant sidekick to the hero indeed and no wonder he bagged a role in our Thalaivar's movie. Keep going Karuna you were amazing.

Siddarth: Well he has come out of his chocolate boy image and good to see Siddarth accepting the role even though the movie is mainly centered on Simha. He was cool as usual and he has done his part really well.

Guru Somasundaram: Was he kept under the wraps after Aranya Kandam and Pandiya Nadu? Was Kollywood not ready to accept brilliant people? Well he was one Person whom i really liked and his characterisation was brilliant as the Filmmaking Guru. What a performance it was thoroughly enjoyed each and every scene of his. I wish Kollywood uses these brilliant people to get Kollywood to new heights and use him in frequently in meaningful roles such as AranyaKandam and Jigarthanda. Kudos Sir. 

Lakshmi Menen, Ramachandran Durairaj, Aadukalam Naren and Sangili Murugan were apt in their respective roles. Watch out for the Surprises in store in the Vijay Sethupathi Cameo.

Coming to the technicians.

Gavemic U Ary: Brilliant Camera, focus and lighting. I couldn't believe that it was Madurai and it could be shown this beautiful after watching the same old routine Madurai gangster flicks. This one stands out. Without Gavemic's colour and tone the movie wouldn't have been the same as it is now. Its his sheer brilliance that makes this movie complete.

Santhosh Narayan: The beats , the drums the percussions Wow !!!!!!!!!!Awestuck with his brilliant BGM and Songs. Couldn't ask for more. Mesmerised with his sounds and songs.

Last but not the least, Karthik Subbaraj: A commendable attempt and a well written script. You haven't brought in a brilliant story but you have made a brilliant script and transformed it into a brilliant movie. We are asking for more movies of you and your brilliance Karthik. A big thumbs up for you. Brilliant is all i can say.

The thrills , actions , suspense, romance, awesome screenplay, Realistic Acting by the leads and the supporting Characters, brilliant Songs and BGM and an awesome Camera and not to miss the brilliant directing skill of Karthik is the USP of Jigarthanda.

Go watch it only in theatres. Well if you are watching it in pirated CD's you are in for a Big Loss.

My Verdict: Brilliant and Awesome and i go for a rating of 10/10",2H51M

I had totally forgotten what happened (read about it in the news last year), so it was a little bit confusing when he/they talked about the trauma in the first half of the movie. But it was soon apparent that he had lost someone close to him, which made everything make sense.

It is a depressing documentary. But if you only want to see happy things, go watch the Police Academy series or some other uncomplicated movie. This documentary will make you think, and fear losing people close to you (especially if you're a parent). Also, I'm not a movie buff, and don't know all the terms. But the cinematic whatever-it's- called (position and movement of the camera) was great. The director really managed to capture what Nick said, tried to say, and didn't say. I saw the 2D version of the movie, I can imagine that some scenes would have had even more of an impact in 3D, but this was more than good enough.

One of those 'insights' came from Miranda himself, explaining how he based the Hamilton/Burr rivalry on feuding rap adversaries Tupac and Biggie.

This is what this season was about - Sherlock becoming human again, the only thing that was missing from a truly epic story told over the span of four seasons. In this mind numbing psychological thriller, the brilliant acting and inspired direction is only surpassed by the emotional undertone that makes Sherlock find his humane touch - something that he had locked away somewhere within his psyche since his childhood. But that humane aspect of Sherlock's character, though not superficially apparent, always found expression in his love for Dr. Watson and Mary, more so than ever in this season of this epic series. Truly, as Mycroft explains - the man Sherlock is today, is a result of memories suppressed and modified and of deep seated psychological trauma. 

Why then is he a sociopath and not a psychopathic villain like Moriarty or Culverton Smith? Because, he was always a good person deep down even though he did not know about it himself. The finale does a stunning job at giving us an insight into his past, and his troubled childhood, while at the same time giving us a glimpse of his genius intellect as in other episodes. It's a shame that some people are criticizing it for being overtly about psychological twists and less about solving crime. I ask them if they ever truly would have been satisfied with 'Sherlock' if there had been so many unanswered questions at the end of what could well be the last episode ever for the series. This was a story that needed to be told - and told it was, in the most magnificent and epic way possible - something that is well captured in the following quotes near the episode end:

Police Officer - ""He's a great man sir."" 

Lestrade - ""He's better than that. He's a good one.""

As Mary put it aptly at the end - it's all about the legend, the stories and the adventures - a story that might well be the greatest detective story ever told!",

All that said, I was surprised by how much and how consistently I enjoyed this special.

Delivered in his hometown, Minhaj has constructed a personal show that moves through a lot of ground, that serves as somewhat of an emotional roller-coaster, puts a lot of issues on the table, but remains consistently accessible and funny for those such as myself who do not have this frame of reference. Minhaj's timing and polish is of a very high standard, and he makes the show feel really professional and slick, but still keeps that sense of it being an honest performance with freshness and emotion. And it is a 'performance' more than a normal stand-up show. He moves around the stage well, and items such as screens and lighting are well timed around his performance. In the context of a filmed special, I also enjoyed the camera-work, as it knew how to move around him, when to go close etc – it was very well filmed and edited.

Main thing though is that it engages and is funny throughout. Very much one worth seeing.",

This French movie was released in 1902 and represents a revolution for the time, given its length (around fourteen minutes), as compared to the more common two-minute short films then being produced.

A Trip to the Moon directly reflects the theatrical personality of its director, Georges Méliès, whose past as a theater actor and magician influenced the making of the movie. The film boldly experiments with some of the most famous cinematic techniques, such as superimpositions, dissolves, and editing practices that would be widely used later on. Despite the simplicity of its special effects, the film is generally considered the first example of science-fiction cinema. It offers many elements characteristic of the genre - a spaceship, the discovery of a new frontier - and establishes most of its conventions.

Méliès's movie deserves a legitimate place among the milestones in world cinema history. Despite its surreal look, A Trip to the Moon is an entertaining and groundbreaking film able to combine the tricks of the theater with the infinite possibilities of the cinematic medium. Méliès was an orchestrator more than a director; he also contributed to the movie as a writer, actor, producer, set and costume designer, and cinematographer, creating special effects that were considered spectacular at the time. The first true science-fiction film cannot be missed by a spectator looking for the origin of those conventions that would later influence the entire genre and its most famous entries.

In a more general sense, A Trip to the Moon can be regarded as the movie that established the major difference between cinematic fiction and nonfiction. At a time when filmmaking mostly portrayed daily life (such as the films of the Lumière brothers at the end of the 19th century), Méliès was able to offer a fantasy constructed for pure entertainment. He opened the doors to future film artists by visually expressing his creativity in a way utterly uncommon to movies of the time.",13M

It's not just the dream-story and the surreality, it's what Keaton does with it and the importance he places on cinema. This film is even rather unique in using montage in a new way, or showing how much film appeals to the imagination as much as an artistic endeavor.

Thus, this film itself becomes both wildly imaginative and brilliantly artistic... and best of all, it's FUNNY! Thus, it becomes a film for everyone. There's no hard-found artistic conceit that leads to cries of ""Pretentious!"", but still people can say ""It's amazing."" There's no comedic conceit that says, ""Bah, just simple slapstick, it's low-culture!"" because it's rather intelligently done. And it's creative in a way that isn't like an opium-dream.

It was Charlie Chaplin's third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp.  

This movie should be counted among Chaplin's best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights (which I've also seen) as THE best Chaplin movie, but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedy's immortal geniuses.

Having first seen this movie years ago on TV, I saw it again in October 2003 as part of my college's silent-film class, on a poor-quality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen. 

 Even so, I was sufficiently intrigued to buy the GR Chaplin Collection DVD, which has a restored silent version of the film that is so good I haven't even bothered to watch the 1942 sound version that's also on the disc.

The viewing quality of this restored silent version is excellent, although certain minor details are still hard to see, such as the faces of the cards drawn by the Tramp, Jim McKay and Black Larsen as they try to determine who should go out into the blizzard.  On the other hand, in the shot of the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff, the viewing clarity makes clearly visible the wire used to pull the model cabin farther over the edge!

Also, the film seems to skip in the scene when the Tramp dances with Georgia, perhaps due to a transfer problem with the DVD.  But these are minor complaints, and certainly the restoration allows for full appreciation of the film.

The first half-hour of The Gold Rush is in itself worth the purchase price, as it contains some of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in any movie. Even the throwaway bits, such as the Tramp trying to use a crude hand-drawn compass, are more genuinely funny than the extreme gross-out gags offered by most contemporary comedies.  

And the shoe-eating scene is so famously funny that even people watching it for the first time may feel that they've seen it already: this is in no way a bad thing, but merely reflects the fact that the best silent films long ago entered into the collective memory of our culture.

I don't say this to sound pretentious.  I believe that because Chaplin had such influence on the development of movie comedy, that to a certain extent people today may take him for granted.  It's hard to approach his work with fresh eyes only because so many people have watched his movies for so many years.  

For example, before the success of The Kid (1921), Chaplin's first feature film, the movie industry doubted that audiences would accept a film that blended comedy and drama.  In The Gold Rush, Chaplin further explored cinema's potential to be comedy and drama simultaneously.  Only he could have distilled humor from scenes of starvation and struggles to survive the ravings of a madman.

The joy of watching this film today stems from seeing how well Chaplin, as both star and director, finds and maintains the right tone and style for his work, negotiating the fine line between comedy and tragedy.  This is most evident in the scene when McKay and Larsen struggle for the shotgun in the cabin and the Tramp tries desperately to escape the muzzle's aim: the sequence is undeniably hilarious, yet even today the Tramp's grim predicament is just as likely to horrify the viewer.

One pleasure of silent comedies such as The Gold Rush is that the lack of a soundtrack leaves more to the imagination, in the same manner that old-time radio comedy got laughs from funny sound effects that showed the audience nothing.  

When Black Larsen sees the Tramp in the cabin, for example, he enters and slams the door, causing the Tramp to spin around in alarm.  This is the kind of joke that could only work in a silent movie, because no door-slamming sound effect could be quite as funny as the piano score imitating the noise, as rendered by Neil Brand on the DVD.  

The second act, in which the Tramp gives up prospecting, returns to town and becomes infatuated with Georgia, was probably inevitable, as Chaplin realized he couldn't sustain the entire film at the cabin.  Still, he must have drawn much of his inspiration from that one location, because he returns his characters to the cabin in the film's third act. 

 I don't want to spoil the climax for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I believe that even today it remains one of the most vivid depictions in cinema history of man versus the elements, and Chaplin milked all its potential for comedy and suspense.

Mack Swain is hilarious as Jim McKay, creating a memorable comic image with his ridiculously small boots and high-domed fur coat.  Chaplin generously gave him some opportunities to be funny on his own in this film, just as he was content to let Jackie Coogan share the spotlight in The Kid.  From what I've seen of City Lights and Modern Times, he was not so generous in his later films, seeming to think that he himself was the whole show. 

 The Gold Rush may not be a perfect 10 compared to today's more sophisticated stories and special effects.  The ending is cheerfully cynical, improbably reuniting two characters and never revealing Georgia's true feelings for the Tramp.

But the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that's a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today.  What a shame.

Wrongly convicted James Allen serves in the intolerable conditions of a southern chain gang, which later comes back to haunt him.",1932-11-19,"blackmail,escaped prisoner,escape from prison,chain gang,hamburger",8.2,lugonian,2001-11-23,"I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG (Warner Brothers, 1932), expertly directed by Mervyn LeRoy, is one of those rare movies released during the early 1930s to really stand the test of time. Although not the very first film to deal with prison injustice and harsh conditions, this is probably the best of its kind. Based on the story by Robert Burns, a war veteran who twice escaped from a chain gang in Georgia, it seems likely that Warner Brothers would be the only movie studio willing to take risks dealing with a social protest story, but here it is. And while actors like Spencer Tracy or James Cagney might have taken up such a challenge for the role, playing it to conviction, as fate would have it, Paul Muni has turned out to be the best and only choice.

The photoplay focuses on a World War Army veteran named James Allen (Paul Muni), who served his country, earning his medals and now respect of his small community. Regardless of being offered back his old job, he decides to find himself by drifting from state to state, job to job, until he finds something to his liking. Along the way, Jim innocently becomes involved in a robbery by a guy named Pete (Preston Foster). A shoot out occurs by the police, killing Pete and arresting Jim. Because the money was found on his person, the judge (Berton Churchill) sentences Jim to ten years of hard labor in a chain gang prison camp. Due to harsh conditions in a living hell, Jim makes a successful escape, becoming a model citizen over the years rising to the top of his profession in a construction firm, only to be betrayed by his gold-digging wife, Marie (Glenda Farrell) for wanting a divorce so he could marry Helen (Helen Vinson), a socialite. Because of his expose to the media, Jim finds he'll never be given his promised freedom after serving 90 days. He makes his second daring escape into the new world now hit by the Great Depression. In spite of his new found freedom, he finds he'll always be chained for life as a wanted fugitive.

Not exactly a family oriented movie, ""I Am a Fugitive"" is a dark and very realistic drama told in documentary style with a touch of ""film noir."" It includes violence, though mostly taken place off screen, such as the flogging of the convicts who groan out their pain. Unlike other chain gang movies, this one doesn't feature punished convicts being placed in sweat boxes for long periods of time. While Paul Muni would achieve success in later years for his biographical dramas, winning an Academy Award as Best Actor for ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" (Warners, 1936), his role as the doomed Jim Allen, victim of circumstance, is obviously his best and most remembered performance. What makes Muni so different from the other screen actors is that Muni doesn't just play a character, he BECOMES that character.

Full of memorable scenes too numerous to mention, the one that stands out is the scene where Jim, after being brought back to the chain gang on a promise for parole and release within a year, is awaken from his bed by one of the guards to be told that his appeal has been denied and that he will have to serve out his original ten-year sentence. Hearing this, Jim, with unshaved face and looking fairly dirty, looks straight into the camera with tears slowly flowing through his eyes with the expression of disgust and betrayal, making fists with his hands before resting down his head on the pillow. As for the prison escapes, they are well staged, with the second escape more exciting than the first.

Taking support in this hard-hitting drama are Louise Carter (Mrs. Allen); Sally Blane (Alice); Allen Jenkins (Barney, a fellow convict); Edward Ellis (Bomber Wells, Jim's cell-mate); David Landau (First Warden); Edward McNamara (Second Warden); Noel Francis (Linda, the lady of the evening who makes Jim's night's lodging ""comfortable"") and James Bell as the ill-fated convict who suffers from stomach pains. When the movie played on local television back in the 1960s and 70s, it was presented under a shorter title, ""I Am a Fugitive,"" but when distributed to video cassette in the 1980s, its complete title was restored. Other than Paul Muni's Academy Award nomination as Best Actor for his performance as Jim Allen, the movie was honored the Best Picture award, losing ""Cavalcade"" (Fox, 1933).

After all these years, ""I Am a Fugitive"" remains a fast-pace man-on-the-run drama, which holds interest throughout its 93 minutes of screen time, and not so easily to forget once it is all over. With the chain gang system being virtually a thing of the past (younger viewers might ask, ""What is a chain gang?""), the movie is a curious look back as to how prison conditions were like in the early part of the twentieth century, and how the judicial system has changed since then. ""I Am a Fugitive"" available on both VHS and DVD formats, has become a frequent revival on Turner Classic Movies. (****)",1H32M

While McCarey was justly celebrated for his sensitive direction, let's start with the shrewd, shaded screenplay, where nobody's entirely good or bad: The children do mean well, but let selfishness intervene; the aged parents are victims, but they're also unavoidably inconvenient and occasionally annoying. It is, unfortunately, a timeless topic -- parents turning into dependent children, children turning into their parents' parents, and the government yammering ineffectually about the problem decade after decade.

McCarey spins the tale out with subtle humor -- just a wink from Victor Moore, a visual aside by Beulah Bondi, says more than several lines of dialogue would. Plus, this is a couple whose passion has survived the years; they can't keep their hands off each other. The notion's a bit hard to swallow, perhaps a contrivance to tilt the viewer's sympathies more in their direction and away from the thoughtless middle-aged kids. But it does work dramatically and makes the last 20 minutes or so almost unbearably poignant. And the last shot, of Bondi, is unforgettable; it's up there with Garbo in ""Queen Christina.""",1H31M

They only remember what they want to remember.'

In Rashomon the editing tells ½ of the story.  It may feel experimental or unconventional, but Kurosawa perfects the concept second by second, directing and editing.  This film didn't need a big budget to come perfectly to the point.  It's a simple tale, but not a superficial tale.  Different points of view and selective memories ('It's true! I saw it!') don't only make the woods unsafe, but are one of the most universal topics of humanity. 'We humans are weak creatures. That's why we lie, even to ourselves' says it all actually: it's about what people want to hear and when they start being interested at all, apart from wishful thinking.  Selfish excuses vs trust in other people.

Rashomon gets masterful when in one instant there is literally a different point of view: the camera takes another position to shoot the same sequence, thereby forcing the audience to reconsider what they just saw.  That is the sort of storytelling that the supposed masters of cinema in our time yet have to equal, or try to copy when they fail.  Admitted 'Memento' (2000, Nolan) is a truly great one.  Still not THAT universal.  'Pulp Fiction' (1994) didn't come close,  'La Commare Secca' (1962) also didn't.  'Ghost dog: the way of the samurai' (1999) touched another border of the concept, or does it?

The use of (non-original) music in my opinion reveals a certain interest for western influence, not only in Rashomon, but also in Kurosawa's forthcoming films, and is probably why his films were so influential on western filmmakers too.

The cinematography is dynamic and changes scene by scene to emphasize exactly what is going on.  The shadows of leaves and branches, captured by cinematographer Kazuo Miyagawa, make you really feel 'in the woods', while the actors (Toshirô Mifune, Takashi Shimura) convince the remaining part of the audience (which adds up to 100% breathless viewers).  It may be after days that you first realize you saw an important film.  After weeks you realize that you must see it again to comprehend (despite it's only 85 min), and ironically that is just one of the crucial points that Kurosawa made. 10/10",1H28M

I, for one, would be prepared to place it among the ""top ten"" of all time. When I first saw it on British TV many years ago I was excited by the discovery of a form of cinema unlike any other. In the months that followed I began to experience frustration that no other of Ozu's fairly large output was available. At long last ""Ohayu"" turned up. I remember thinking it very inconsequential beside ""Tokyo Story"" but pleasing nonetheless, possibly Ozu not so much having an off-day as a day off. What I found remarkable however was its stylistic affinity to ""Tokyo"", the absence of camera movement, the prefacing of each dramatic sequence, generally taking place in a domestic interior shot from near-ground level, with two or three shots, often still-life exteriors with background music carried over into the next dialogue scene; in other words a director who is completely true to his own way of seeing things, as instantly recognisable from a single shot as are composers as diverse as Martinu, Rawsthorne and Roy Harris from one bar of their music. It is only recently that I have managed to catch up with five other Ozu films, each a gem in its own way but small in scale. ""Early Summer"" is a typical example. It deals with the same situation as ""Late Spring"", that of the pressures on a young woman by her family to get married. Ozu generally explores family relationships which, although hardly dysfunctional, abound in tensions. Here we have an elderly couple living with their doctor son and their unmarried daughter, the son's wife and their two small sons completing the household. An elderly uncle visits early on and neighbours and friends, particularly those of the unmarried daughter make up the rest of the cast played by a company of stock actors that appear in many of Ozu's films. Each generation responds to life in its own way. The elderly couple are disappointed particularly with the younger members of the family. They sit on park benches or in the privacy of their bedroom and sigh that, in spite of everything, things could be much worse and they should be happy with their lot. The middle generation get on with the business of living, often in a blinkered way so that we wonder whether they are aware of the tensions they so often generate. The children are completely selfish little monsters who cut up rough if they don't get their own way, as when they mistake a wrapped loaf of bread that their father brings home, for the model railway accessories they are hoping to receive. There is little in the way of plot other than that of the ""Will she? Won't she?"" variety. But for the enormous expectations raised by ""Tokyo Story"", I might well have passed ""Early Summer"" by.

In this sense the English stiff upper lip is less of a human trait, but more a phenomenon deliberately shaped by cultural ideology and attitudes from the upper classes of English society. This causes the human, as illustrated with precision in The Browning Version by Michael Redgrave, to subdue feelings, and by so doing transform the human being into a mere mechanism of an ordered society which serves to function as apposed to lives life.

For illustrating how the elimination of human feelings can be so destructive to mind, body and soul, here Redgrave deserves all accolades awarded him. Clearly one of the finest actors in cinematic history.

Just to add here that it is not a weakness to illustrate feelings but as the film states strongly, it is more of a failure to hide them.

This is a lesson in how the human condition can in the end and ultimately triumph over suppression of life itself.

I've watched it as the 44th movie in a collection of 50 so-called art-house films in a DVD collection from Criterion. These allegedly ""essential"" movies are presented alphabetically and that is how I've viewed them, so it's taken me quite some time to get to the letter U. If I'd started with this De Sica classic I may have felt disinclined to watch any of the others! 

Indeed, in a lifetime of over 50 years of watching movies - everything from the truly execrable to the totally inspirational - this is the first and only film I've ever sought to review on this site. I know there are a few detractors out there on the message-boards who cannot see beyond their own cynicism, but I pity them. This movie remains timeless, as potent as when it was made in 1952. You don't have to be old, you don't have to be a dog-lover (although it helps), and you certainly don't have to be a fan of neo-realist Italian cinema. All you have to be is a good human being. Watching this movie is a sort of 'humanity test' and thankfully most of the reviewers here have passed it.

I had never seen an Ozu film before, but now I feel as if I must see them all.  His use of cinematic space is incredible.  He breaks all sorts of conventions with his cinematography such as violating the axis of action. This gives the viewer the sense of a large, open, unrestricted world.

Going with this realism, the characters seem real; not for a moment did I see the people on the screen as actors.  They were the family, and you as the viewer feels what they feel.  Part of this comes from the use of head-on-shots such that the characters are speaking TO you.

Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. ""Dial M for Murder"" will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony and right after that kissing passionately her American lover, writer (Robert Cummings) in the red dress, immediately, without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion, deception, betrayal, and ultimately, murder will follow. 

Ray Milland (Tony Wendice) is a surprisingly sympathetic villain (which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent, charm, and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart) who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money (she is a wealthy one in the family). His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses. Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a cold-blooded murderess. Now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case.

As always with Hitchcock, his directing is impeccable, the camera rarely leaves Wendice's apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays' adaptation. It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours. I would not call ""Dial M for Murder"" my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable, clever, and witty thriller with the interesting twists, outstanding performances, and more than one truly memorable scenes.",1H45M

A red balloon with a life of its own follows a little boy (Pascal Lamorisse , son of director Albert Lamorisse) around the streets of Paris . Balloon and young boy play together in the streets and slums of Paris and attempt to elude a band of boys that wants to explode the balloon . 

This timeless movie displays haunting and powerful scenes , it's plenty of frames which stay forever in the mind and there is almost no dialog spoken . The story is narrated with sensitivity and intelligence and is treated a simple adventure developed in great sense of ductility and fairness . In spite of runtime is short , this is a medium-length film, as the run is 35 minutes , it is entertaining , amusing and funny . The gentle humor developed in the film is clever and agreeable and dealing with fantastic as well as surrealist deeds . The plot is plain and simple though is only set in Parisian streets , it isn't dreary , neither boring but fun . Director tirelessly maintains the humorous ingenuity and including fantasy as when the balloon following the little boy around like a pet . Spectacular as well colorful finale when other balloons of various sizes and colors descend on the boy from all parts of Paris, and together they lift him into the sky and take him away over the horizon . Lively musical score is enjoyable and cheerful . The motion picture received awesome reviews and deserves the complete knowledge , acquiring an international reputation for its poetic quality ; receiving a grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and also winning an American Academy award. In fact , with its Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay, the film is the only short film to win an Academy award outside of the short film categories . The picture is nowadays considered to be an European cult film and it had one of the largest non-theatrical runs in the history of American cinema , as thousands of 16-millimeter prints were distributed to schools across the country. 

The motion picture was stunningly directed by Albert Mamorisse , he was born in Paris and was killed, at 58 , in a helicopter crash while shooting a documentary near Teheran . He was former photographer, he turned to directing short subjects in the late 40s, and 50s involving the childhood and fantastic events . His most successful movies were ¨Crin Blanc¨ (1953) also starred by his son Pascal Lamorisse and ¨The Red balloon¨ (1956) , the latter winning an Academy Award , as it won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, even though it has little dialogue . In the early 60s he turned to feature length films such as ¨Bim¨ and ""Stowaway in the Sky"" equally starred by his son Pascal , but with considerably less success, then retreated to documentary shorts . His last picture was ¨Le Vent Des Amoureux¨ (1978), a visually stunning helicopter tour of Iran, was later edited from his notes and was nominated for an Oscar as best feature documentary for the Academy award ceremonies of 1979.",34M

Godfrey was JUST like this movie in this respect: on the air, he was America's home-spun hero..telling folksy stories....crooning in an off tone baritone, and presenting pure, CLEAN entertainment. OFF the air,however the legend that is Arthur Godfrey to this day is one of THE biggest control freaks in show biz history..to the point of controlling the lives of all of his 'family'..unfortunately that turned out to be downfall...One Julius LaRosa had been a singer that Godfrey had 'discovered' in the US Navy Band...after he was discharged LaRosa became a singer on Godfrey's nighttime TV show ""Arthur Godfrey and Friends"",where he became an instant star among the bobby sox set. In time, LaRosa started a recording career,and started to have VERY successful records..then suddenly, in 1953, Godfrey suddenly fired LaRosa from his show for the mysterious reason of him having 'no humilty' ...it has been assumed since then that Godfrey was extremely jealous of Larosa's success...Anyways, this exposed the 'real' Godfrey to the public.,and while it didn't happen as quickly or as totally as Lonesome Rhodes' career,Godfrey's career as a superstar was effectively over after that..he eventually was reduced to hosting game shows and such. Writer Schulberg obviously also puts in his 2 cents on fame...politics..the show business...and early television here, but as I said,there wasn't NO ONE in those days who didn't know it was about Godfrey....",2H6M

As usual, the answers are to be provided by the audience.  We must chose for ourselves what we think is 'right' or 'just'. Bergman uses the usual pattern for him - a man is on a journey (life) and meets people who are going along the same road (friends and family), and they all head toward the end of their trip (death).  They stop in for obligatory visits with relatives and for food (as we all do), receive an honourary degree (fame & success?), and then send the children off to a party held in our honour that we do not attend (funeral).  What happens along the way is important, but we always end up in the same place - the end. Wonderful editing techniques, good story, good images, fantastic acting, and more ideas and questions to ponder than one film can hold - or so you thought.  It's only after the film ends that these ponderings come to you. During the film, you simply watch a man travel from his home to another city, but this is far from what the film is about.

The most interesting thing is perhaps how the two actors handle their roles: Sordi is very calm, controlled and ""normal"", while Gassman just can't stop being nervous, shouting and gesticulating all the time.

What makes ""Some Like it Hot"" different is two things: the strength of its comedy, and the presence of Marilyn Monroe, then at the height of stardom.

Lemmon and Curtis turn in admirable performances both as Joe and Jerry, and as Josephine and Daphne. Tony Curtis does Lemmon one better by creating a third identity, ""Junior"", in order to woo Sugar Kane (Monroe).

Tying the pair's story into the Chicago Valentine's Day Massacre, where a gang war spilled over into a parking garage, leaving a number of people lined up against the wall and shot, is a deft touch (though the serious tone of these gang sequences contrasts sharply with the bulk of the movie).

The movie does an excellent job building the far-fetched stakes of the movie ever-higher, from their finding refuge from vengeful gangs in a women's jazz band, to their showdown in the Florida hotel, to the eventual revealing of Curtis' and Lemmon's identities. The movie's surprisingly suggestive and risque content is at odds with the time frame of the movie, and even with the period of the movie's creation. The many smart double-entendres and plays on words are very well-written, and alternate between lowbrow and highbrow comedy,

The films only fault might be a couple of overlong musical numbers, performed either by the whole band or soloed by Sugar Kane. Though to be expected in a Marilyn Monroe film, these musical acts are literal ""show stoppers"" that bring the comedic momentum of the film to a screeching halt.

Judge Hayward along with two other judges (Ray Teal, Kednneth Mackenna), to preside over the trial of Ministry of Justice, judges and Nazi prosecutors for their complicity in Third Reich. Hayward is helped by his assistant Harrison (William Shatner). In its opening declaration , the prosecution (an excellent prosecutor played by Richard Widmark) calls these defendants to account not for violation of due process or other constitutional violations but for killings, tortures, and cruelties committed during WWII. The accuser statements that the accused cannot claim ignorance that they should have known better for their high position and knowledges.Defender Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) counsel's opening statement he declares that the aim of this judgment is the reestablishment of the code of justice with honor and innocence, because of judges don't make the laws .

Finally the defending explains that not only are the judges on trial, so are the German people.One of the more dramatic portions of the film centers around Judge Janning's (Burt Lancaster) performance during the Feldenstein case (in real life, the Katzenberger case). Fedlenstein was charged with race mixing, of having relations with an Aryan, Irene Hoffman (Judy Garland). The trial was to be used as a showcase for National Socialism. Emil Hahn (Werner Kemplerer) had been the accuser and he was determined to find Feldenstein guilty despite evidence that he had merely been a family friend to Irene Hoffman. Hahn had told Irene that it was no use to deny having relations. That if she protected Feldenstein she would be arrested for perjury. She said she couldn't lie and was arrested. She said that Emil Hahn mocked Feldenstein, ridiculed him. Janning had been the presiding judge and he took no action to prevent the injustice. He had been the only hope for the defense since he had a reputation for being fair. Feldenstein was found guilty and executed.Prosecutor Lawson (Richard Widmark) submitted documents by which the judges and prosecutors had sent thousands to their deaths.

More than six million Jews died in them, usually in gas chambers, although many were killed in mass shootings and by other means . As the documentary showed a gas chamber at Dachau , but it is a mistake because of it was never used, prisoners died from mistreatment or from execution by means other than gas. The archival footage shows tattooed skin , but Buchenwald prisoners with unusual tattoos were killed , then their skin was preserved for the tattoo collection of convicted war criminal Ilse Koch. Defense counsel speaks to the content of the films shown the previous day. He states that there is no justification for what happened, but, that it was wrong and unfair to show such films in court against these defendants. He claims that the extremists are responsible, not the defendants. He says that very few Germans knew what was going on. He claimed that the defendants stayed in their positions to keep things from getting worse. The defending then calls Irene Hoffman. In this unseemly portion of the defense, the defense counsel tries to portray Irene Hoffman as a law breaker and Judge Janning as merely doing his duty. The hypocrisy is evident and seems to bother even defense counsel Rolfe. Yet he continues to badger Irene, trying to break her down, to show that she did in fact have an affair with Feldenstein. Janning interrupts him and stops him from continuing.The next day Janning testifies about the Feldenstien case. He tells that there was fear in the country. That Hitler told the people to lift their heads. That once the gypsies, Jewish, and others were destroyed all would be well.Janning was content to sit by during his trial until he realized the same arguments were being used in this trial in his defense that had been used in the Feldenstien trial. Janning denies that Germans were unaware of the exterminations. He says that all were aware of what was going on, maybe not the details, but only because they did not want to know the details.Judge Hayward affirms the value of a single human life, and the responsibility of the justices, and by implication the German people, for their actions and inaction. 

This graphic account of the Nuremberg trials were immediately brought to book and subsequently adapted by Stanley Kramer in ¨Playhouse ¨ style. Judge Haywood is perfectly played by Spencer Tracy, he gives us the uneasy feeling that the German people never really came to terms with their innocence or guilty. This film takes the point of view that Germany, at the time of the picture was realized, was moving beyond the war a little too fast, and was doing so with the help of the US and other allies because of the Cold War. For his passionated acting of the defending advocate Maximilian Schell won an Oscar as the years's best player and special mention Montgomery Clif, also uncredited as screenwriter. Rating : Excellent, better than average.",2H59M

A hungry and tired rōnin wanders through a desolate Japanese countryside. Soon, he arrives in a small town. A local caterer advises him to leave because, two local clans fight every day on the streets. However, a stranger decides to stay. The situation in a town is very good for one rōnin. This is a good chance that he earns some money. However, he does not need a bloody money. He wants to destroy local crime lords...

This tense story is full of lies, doubt, turning, pranks, blackmails and excellent fights. A careless and seemingly insensitive samurai is actually a peaceful and good man. Mr. Kurosawa has, under the influence of a western and noir, made a very exciting and visually impressive film. Of course, he has not neglected the significant situations that are related to the Japanese culture and tradition.

Close-ups, almost perfectly, reflect an evil, arrogance, fear, invincibility and contempt on faces of some of the protagonists. There is a large number of villains, which are quite different in character.

Toshiro Mifune (Kuwabatake Sanjuro) is a resourceful, interesting and determined as a wandering rōnin and master swordsman. He, apparently, enjoys in his machinations, however, his goal is extremely benevolent. He's kind of a lone hero, regardless of a tactical evil and theatrical swagger in his character.

His support are Tatsuya Nakadai as Unosuke a wild and insolent gunslinger and the biggest threat to a samurai. He is interesting because he is a completely different character from Sanjuro. Kyū Sazanka (Ushitora) and Seizaburo Kawazu (Seibei) are fairly inconclusive as crime lords. However their primary relationship ""of a teacher and his student"", could be interesting. Isuzu Yamada as Orin is the the wife of Seibei. She is perhaps an initiator of conflicts. Daisuke Katō as Inokichi is a visually the most memorable character. A character, who is capable to commit a vicious murder, but also make the greatest stupidity.

Simply, Mr. Kurosawa has managed to combine several styles in a small masterpiece.",1H50M

I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.  

I first read Harper Lee's lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family.  The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.

Every time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch.  He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs.  He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots.  Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.  

Those who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone.  Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career, and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen.  The cinematography is also beautiful, and the script is perfectly balanced-not too sparse, but also not dialogue heavy.

The best thing about ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people.  This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance, loving families, and the beauty of life through a child's eyes.  Everyone who watches movies ought to see it.",2H9M

Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.

 It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. 

As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.

As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see ""Hart's War"" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).

All in all, ""The Great Escape"" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",2H52M

Throughout four vignettes, we see a Havana prostitute struggling to make ends meet, a humble farmer whose livelihood is destroyed by landowners, students fighting against the repressive police, and finally, people joining up with the revolutionary army.

The whole thing is really socialist realism: the heroic peasants rising up against the oppressive bourgeoisie and getting martyred. But, we have to admit that what ""I Am Cuba"" portrays is accurate. I don't know for sure whether or not things got much better after the revolution, but most Cubans certainly prefer things as they are today over how things were under Batista. Either way, the movie can also be interpreted through its camera work, showing Cuba's landscape and employing some interesting dollies.

Tony befriends Ms, Lautmann and helps her in the store and repairs her furniture, and lures his wife with his salary. When the Jews are expelled from the town by the fascist, Tony decides to help the old lady. 

""Obchod na Korze"" is one of those movies that make you laugh and cry.

I concur with most of the comments from the other users. Certainly Ophuls' directorial hand is evident throughout, the editing, cutting, juxtaposition, reaction shots etc are all part of the construction of his argument, although his interviewees are obviously allowed to account for themselves at some length.

What I found most surprising was the amount of humour in the film. Because of Woody Allen's use of it in ""Annie Hall"" I thought it would be gruelling, but there were a number of laugh out loud moments, starting with the resistance leader whose main stated reason for fighting the Germans was that they were monopolising the best meat.

Emmanuel d'Astier de la Vigerie was also a total star. His comment about the sociological make-up of the Resistance - essentially misfits and malcontents, people with nothing to lose - was very telling. A number of other interviewees made similar points - the main collaborators were the bourgeoisie - the resistance was mainly based on workers, peasants, communists, youth and weirdos of various sorts. Compare that with the sitation in the '60s when the film was made and with the situation now in the western democracies.

Anthony Eden was another major surprise. The popular image of him now is of a buffoon, the man who screwed up Suez, but in the extended interview here he displays immense charisma, intelligence and humanity. And if they make a film of his life Jeremy Irons is a shoo-in for the role.

The Nazis, meanwhile, are clearly cut from the same cloth as the neo-fascists presently enjoying something of a resurgence in most of Europe. All the same arguments made in exactly the same way by the same sort of people. This (plus the smugness of the former Wehrmacht officer still wearing his medals) was probably the most chilling thing about the film.

The final obvious resonance is with Iraq. From the German soldiers baffled and outraged by the fact that some French were trying to kill them, to the French establishment referring to the Resistance as terrorists, (yes that was the exact word they used), to the initial acceptance of the Occupation turning to hatred as reprisals against the Resistance grew, many testimonies throw a radically new light on the present situation. To draw direct parallels would be a mistake - even the Gaullists were not as reactionary as Zarqawi or Muqtada al Sadr - but nonetheless there is a lot to learn from then about now, and about the difference between how events are perceived at the time and by History.

Another user comment complains about the amount of politics in the film. It's true that some knowledge is presupposed and the film would obviously mean more to those who lived through those times. However Ophuls has said that one of his main motivations was to show that the idea that you can divorce politics from everyday life is exactly what made collaboration possible.

These are just a few of the thoughts provoked by the film, which holds many more insights and surprises and I am sure repays as many viewings as Alvy Singer gave it. It's perhaps not as shocking or affecting as ""Shoah"" (on which it's surely the strongest influence) but then it's a different story. It shows us the best of humanity as well as the worst and neither are always where you might expect to find them.

Incidentally, it looks like the reportedly poor quality of the DVD may be down to the original film stock rather than the transfer.",4H11M

It was definitely a surprise to the entire group doing really well with their German. Graham Chapman even attempted to imitate an American tourist speaking German poorly. However, quite a bit of the narration was provided by a professional German announcer. 

At first the whole 45 minute effort seemed off and I thought that it was probably since comedy is 90% timing and if you are not comfortable speaking then your timing will likely be off. Later I thought that the material was repetitive from the British show (in tone not content) but that was because the Python crew knew that the German audiences were probably not familiar with their work. As the show progressed and we get an unusual amount of ""toilet"" humor, I thought that possibly they were using rejected / censored material from their British show. Then I noticed that the whole production was on film instead of the film/ live studio mix of the British show. That's when I realized why I didn't fully enjoy this production.

Compare the troupe's skits from the TV show (most of which were performed in front of live audiences) with the same skits in the film ""And For Something Completely Different"". The energy and timing, the use of multiple TV cameras versus one film camera and the input from the audience all combined to improve their work. Imagine if they had done the Bavarian restaurant sketch on their regular show, it would have been funny as opposed to amusing.

Her role as Mabel was perfect in a film that sometimes was not even as it just tried for suburban truth. I was constantly curious about where her character was headed, and even more so by how I did not feel any desire at all to pass judgment on her. The moment I would have thought to myself ""well, she's too nuts to like"" the film would be ruined for me. And that is one of the more intelligent points to the film that Cassavetes gets at. 

This is, after all, a character-based film, with story merely in the background. And with his two main characters we get a look at what has been a stereotype for centuries- men are often brutal and stupid, women are crazy. In this filmmakers world, it's just not that black and white, however, but with the grays as pronounced as the highs and lows in a melodrama; it's just the way he sees things, and it's a unique way as well, where the soul and choice are the precedents over comfy dramatic circumstance.

I loved the use of the camera in many scenes, how it felt like they just shot and shot and went from one spot in the house to the next, uncertain but knowing how to observe and look. In fact, the whole film has the feel of a documentary, with the occasional dramatic touch such as a close-up. But what turns it into being something special is that Cassavetes understands that Falk, Rowlands and the others can take his script and make it their own, very personally so. And as it happens, Falk finds some of his most daring work here as Nick, a character who in his own way has become as nuts as Mabel with the everyday grind of living (which for both of them is filled with people, talk, pure humanity). 

For those who don't like the easy solutions in dramas, or want to know the basics of the post-modern independent film movement, this is for you. It might seem to drag in spots, but it seems to be even more enveloping if one gives it the time to contemplate over those 'drag' moments.",2H35M

If you have never seen Monty Python before it will either change your life and how you look at comedy or you will scratch your head and wonder what is so funny.

In this farcical story King Arthur (to me a brilliant performance and played extremely straight by Graham Chapman) armed with his Knights of the Round Table is on his search for the Holy Grail.They come face to face with deadly black knights, killer rabbits and lonely lustful nuns to name a few.

There really isn't a low point in the film as the laughs keep coming and ridiculous characters keep showing up. My favourite scenes are King Arthur's sword fight with the black knight (John Cleese), meeting the Knights Who Say Ni! lead by Michael Palin and dealing with the bridgekeeper (Terry Gilliam) of the Bridge of Death.

While this is a film from Python about one thing that being King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail it still to me has the soul of sketch comedy due to silly characters that show up for generally one scene and then you move onto the next character. Which to me is completely fine. I think this group may have been the absolute best at sketch comedy.

Now they could have probably shoved it all into one film but by stretching it out, you get a very thorough look at the process. However, because the three films were brought out years apart, there is LOTS of overlap--lots. Unfortunately, because the crackdown on the left was so extreme, you also get little footage of the atrocities--but interviews with families whose members simply disappeared.

Part two does NOT pick up immediately after part one--it more runs in parallel at times. It follows the steps leading from government disunity and an initial coup (that failed) to the successful coup only a short time later.

Even if you are more to the right politically, this is an interesting film (as are the other two), as it's rare to see a film document, through live film, the fall of the government. Plus, although I don't think a communist-socialist government is a very good form of government, it WAS legally elected and you can't feel happy about coups and assassinations.

 In all former Soviet states this film is still loved and admired, so It's pity that non-Russian speaking audience will never get even 10% of its jokes and humor. There are several reasons for this:

 1) To understand this (and actually all soviet film) one must not just know the Russian language - one must know the Soviet system, soviet culture, lifestyle.

 2) Those who think that Soviet UNION=Russia are very wrong, and here the fact that USSR consisted of 15 different states (and hundreds of nations actually) has  a great importance - as the story concerns  the ""adventures"" of two southerners (a Georgian and an Armenian) in Moscow (that was both capital of Russia and USSR)-great deal of humor comes from their accents, as well as cultural differences. The director himself is Georgian who mostly lives in Russia and most of his films concern Russia (almost all of them are very popular in Russia) Only in one film (Ne Goryui!- that is equally as good as this one though very different) the action takes place in Georgia. (other much recommended films are Kin-Dza-Dza and Autumn Marathon..)

 3) It is very important to know certain cultural confrontation that existed in USSR and still exists in Russia -  Caucasians (Russia is the only v\country where this term means ""black, dark person"" - i.e. Georgians, Armenians, Azeri, and others) are rather unpopular in Russia (Russian nationalists consider them second main enemy after Jews, now  due to Chechnya war Caucasian people became the most unpopular in Russia ); Characters of Georgian And Armenian visually fit the most standard stereotypes that exist in Russia (- big flat hat, moustaches, etc.) Armenians and Georgians for thousands of years had rivalry and competition, each trying to prove that it is older, better, and more cultural than the other;


* AND DESPUITE ALL THIESE Danelia MADE a film where there is no national problem    - there are good people and not so good people, friendship and understanding between all these nations win - and therefore the film has a great political-subtexts - though it is delivered so lightly and tenderly that nobody thinks to call it propaganda or political film- its just a CLASSIC SOVIET COMEDY, delicious and funny, not that slapstick-cake-into-face staff, but film about real people, real feelings and real values.",1H35M

When I watch a film in a foreign language I find myself studying facial expressions and body language very closely, not surprisingly as, with the lack of understanding I am more dependant of visual cues. However such scrutiny often uncovers failings and weaknesses  not here.

The cinematography id also first class, the colours, tones and lighting are all superb and enhance, never detract.

This is only the second of Bergman's films I have seen (the first being Fanny and Alexander) and what I have noticed is that while many films give to the viewer and I feel as if the emotions are a natural response, I felt with the Bergman films, particularly this one, as if the films have taken something out of me, as if the emotions have been extracted against my will. This may sound over the top and rather florid but is a genuine statement. I also have to say that what the two films have in common is that they were both spellbinding and like a good book that just can't be put down, the films gripped me and wouldn't let go even for a minute.",1H39M

 This was the first music doco to be shot on 35mm and watching the concert, you'd think that each performance was carefully choregraphed over a few weeks of shooting rather than over one night. Special thanks must be given to Cinematogrpaher Michael Chapman for his efforts on this film. The look of the film is what elevates it's overall appeal, because the music was always going to be epic, especially with the cavalcade of great names performing.

Yet 'An Oridnary Miracle' is much more than just one in a bunch.

What we have here is a tale coming to life, an allegory in its full sense. The plot is centered around the Wizard, played superbly by Oleg Yankovsky, and his wife (another fantastic performance by Irina Kupchenko). The Wizard utters words, and we see them come to life - literally. He is dictating every move of this story, setting the pace and force of action. Creating a solid world by imagination, a world that stumbles upon his tired wife and wouldn't leave until set right.

The center of this imaginary world is a love story, a fairy tale of a bear turned into a man who has to be kissed by a princess to return to his true form. Zakharov handles this in a beautiful way. The love story is very romantic, yet never too sweet, accompanied with superb supporting characters of the King (Yevgeni Leonov) and his Minister Administrator (Andrei Mironov), the very stars of the Soviet Russian cinema.

Everything is very theatrical in this movie. Anotther commenter here mentioned it's due to Zakharov's occupation as a theatre director. Yet it seems there's more to it, since other pictures of his hold less of this stage atmosphere. Having seen this movie numerous times, i like to think this 'theatricity' as, for one, an homage to Shvarts' plays, and also as yet another allegory of life and imagination, when everyone of us can be creators of many things. Creating our own life, which is nothing but an (un)ordinary miracle.

The whole movie, i think, comes to a simple truth, articulated in many masterpieces (it would fit to remember Tarkovsky here): it is difficult to be a creator. This gift comes with its own rules, sometimes far beyond control. Yet by allowing it to come, we can produce small, ordinary miracles. To quote the theme song of the movie, 'awkwardly, funnily, illogically, mindlessly - miraculously'.",2H18M

It is about a Captain, Cpn. Vrungel and his crew as they race in an international regatta while a high-profile theft of a priceless statue from a museum is investigated. The depressed card-playing transporter of the statue stumbles onto Vrungel's boat by coincidence and joins their crew, which leads them to be followed by two gangsters who have to steal the statue back for their boss, whose lips are only seen until the last episode when his identity is revealed. The statue, the gangsters are in turn followed by a British secret agent.

This is a show in around a dozen episodes (as IMDb says , 88 mins. in total). The show takes the heroes on insane adventures, from rescuing squirrels from a burning forest and them trying to sell them, to washing ashore in Hawaii. They might go to the pyramids, and in the end the regatta possibly ends in Britain. The classic joke from the start of the show is that their boat is named ""PABEDA"", which means ""victory"", but the first two letters get torn off and it says ""beda"" which now means ""misfortune"".

The most unique thing about this show is the animation. Imagine South Park type of cut out characters, only imagine the characters MUCH more detailed, their clothes, their faces, their hands, they are just incredibly beautifully drawn and animated! The show also combines live film footage, still photography and other unusual effects to create weird images. For instance the parts when they are sailing on the sees usually have a filmed ocean as a background. The animation alone is a complete treat. It really affords so many new effects and movements and jokes. There is also normal animation used at times. Also with the animation are incredible backgrounds which have a lot of work put into the textures and colors.

The music is great, especially the main theme - what a classic soviet melody! Throughout the show, characters sing their own songs which are really entertaining to watch and they are all very good. The music really adds a lot to the show, from adding a serious tension when necessary, to having a light sunny sea-faring atmosphere when it's smooth sailing. The music of this show gets imprinted into your soul.

One thing I love a lot is the use of different languages and accents and parodies of other cultures. The two gangsters go off on crazy non-sensical Italian rants, so does an American one-legged Captain of another ship who always cracks me up. Another main character is a British secret agent, I think his name is 00X, who is a suave big toothed guy.

This show is absolutely kid-friendly, there's almost no scary or bloody scenes here, except for the comedic mafia chasing them, so there is guns involved. But all little kids in Russia loved this show. Anyone would fall in love with these guy's adventures. The whole show is a very happy one, and very very funny. It has awesome elements of spy, adventure, technology, geography and music, and of course friendship. 10/10, this is beyond classic, this is just a part of every little kid's life who grew up the soviet union. And also it is made with incredible care, love and talent.",

The survival techniques the characters in the film achieve is unlike anything I've seen in film.

If he picks the easy option he gets to choose from two more. If he picks the tougher one there is a good chance he won't be given another. It is not just true of Anant Welankar, the young policeman in Govind Nihalani's Ardh Satya. The tougher choice looks brave and laudable, but it could quickly lead downhill. Developed from a poem by the same name, Ardh Satya is about the limbo marking the spot between cowardice and courage. It could either mean a compromise or a sign of intelligence. It is not either half-full or half-empty. It is both half-full and half-empty. On a scale of courage, this marks the middle between ""impotence"" and ""manhood"".

On one side is Impotence, and on the other is Manhood, and right in the middle, is the half-truth.

The sub-inspector played by Om Puri is much respected by his colleagues. They have all accepted their positions in the ""potency scale"" somewhere sliding to the negative. For every move this upstart of a cop makes towards the upkeep of his ""manhood"" – by ramming into the local goon's criminal activity or correcting eve-teasers – he is reminded of his eventual powerlessness. The system won't allow for his manhood because it is a secular place full of compromises. For Welankar, there is no half-truth. Rama Shetty (the goon) has to be put in jail. Thanks to everyone else, it cannot be done. It takes his naiveté to overlook the half-truth, the safe-house for everyone afraid of the full truth. For him, it is either one or the other. To fight this inner conflict he takes to the bottle, the universal succor he hopes will find him the middle of the scale. In turn, his drinking makes him more violent. He takes the system's cowardice as his own and stretches the limits of bravery. There is only trouble at the other end, but he pushes on, all the time answering the inner call to be a man. The memory of his father often beating his mother enrages him. Even that anger is more at himself than the father for he didn't stop him. All the while, the policeman opts for courage, but is forced to accept cowardice. Then he is given another choice. Then it goes again, the same way. Perhaps, there is no Ardh Satya and it is all just plain lies. But then, what's the point of the complete truth if it won't allow you another choice.",2H10M

It is endearing in it's simplicity, full of humanity and wonder. This film, which I saw in the Soviet Union in 1984 (when it was first released)touched me very deeply. To this day, I remember watching it every time it was shown on television and when the last of the 5 series ended, I couldn't wait to see it again. It has been a great inspiration and is one of the reasons that I am pursuing a career in filmmaking. I wish that more of American films, especially those for children, were made with so much heart. In the U.S., it is available through Russian video stores, specifically in Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, NY. Unfortunately, they are not subtitled.

Children, barely old enough to take care of themselves ran amok on the streets, had drug habits and prostituted themselves for some food money. They had parents that beat them or were in jail or molested them and that life on the streets was preferred to life at home.

I appreciate that this movie was so truthful and showed what life is really like out on the streets when you open your eyes.

Even the dance that is normally associated with it, (Zeimbetiko), occasionally looks like some kind of ritualistic act of defiance, to those ancient Greek deities, who for their own amusement, are constantly interfering with all our lives, creating Tragedy, Comedy, Pathos and Irony. It had traditionally been associated with Greek refugees from the west coast of Anatolia, who for various reasons, had become dispossessed and were now confined to living their lives under the lower step of the Greek urban social order, engaged in a life style that was considered borderline at best, in more ways then one. The time depicted in this film, covers a period in Athens from about 1922 -1958. This was a time of tremendous transition and instability for the entire Greek nation.  The film begins with a montage of what the Greeks have called the Asia Minor Disaster, which was basically a military campaign (waged with rival nation Turkey) gone wrong, and which resulted in a population exchange with their nemesis nation, that increased the population in Greece by approximately 25% almost overnight, in 1923. Most of them ending up in Athens. In was in these overcrowded and economically and spiritually destitute conditions during the 1930's, that the Rembetiko genre of music reached its height in popularity.   After that, came a World War and Nazi occupation in 1940, and then a tragic Civil War in 1948.

On to even more economic and political instability thru-out the 1950's.  In ""Rembetiko the movie"" veteran Director Costas Ferris, much akin to a masterpainter,  uses these historical events, by either showing or suggesting them, to recreate a background of a social order, that always seems to be on the edge of chaos and collapse.  Scenery, costumes, period piece trivia etc. are all well executed and are quite successful in recreating a realistic and believable visual context for the period.  The viewer will have little difficulty in the area movie pundits love to call ""the suspension of disbelief"". Winner of the prestigious Silver Bear award in 1984, and without question, one of the most absorbing and  provocative films ever to come out of the Hellenic Republic, this is a story that works on many levels, from the superficially romantic and absurd to the exceedingly tragic and disturbingly profound. This is especially true if one is  familiar with the history and urban culture of contemporary Greece, during the early and middle years of this century. This 107 minute Hellenic ""Once Upon a Time"" for adults,  is both controversial and unforgettable.  The basic storyline may seem somewhat simplistic, but that simplicity is deceptive.  There is a great deal going on here that is not always plainly evident.  Some of the events portrayed, are based upon the actual life experience of one Marika Ninou, who in reality, had in fact been a well known Rebetisis from that period. A Rebetisis today, is simply a term used for a female singer of Greek Rebetiko music.  However during the period in question, being called a Rebetisis had a connotation, that was somewhat more pejorative in nature. The film follows the life experiences of the primary character, also named Marika, from the day of her unwanted birth and exceedingly difficult childhood,  to her rise and eventual decline, as a popular Rebetisis, while still only in her mid thirties.  She is essentially a very complex character, who is driven by a blind ambition to succeed in her singing career, while simultaneously being sustained through every ordeal in her life, by nothing more, then an enormous strength of character along with an equally strong determination and  will to survive.  However, in her quest to the top,  she becomes increasingly self-centered, detached and alienated, as both  personal relationships and the overwhelming external events surrounding and affecting her life, spin quickly out of control. Nevertheless finding a deep rooted empathy for her came easy and naturally.  In the beginning of the film, Marika is a young women in search of artistic recognition for her music.  By the end of the film, ( in a final scene, that can only best be described as quintessentially Greek ), she is, in a very curious and symbolic way, redeemed by it ! Sortiria Leonardou gives a Tour de Force performance as Marika, while the glorious and haunting original Rembetiko compositions of Stavros Xarhakos, permeate the entire production.  This is a very powerful film !!",1H50M

Adapted by Kurosawa from Shakespeare's King Lear, Ran undoubtedly features amongst the best works of the master auteur. It captures with sheer vividness and surreal resplendence, the true essence of human struggle for survival, highlighting the cruelties associated with life. Ran is strictly indicative of the sole consistency of life i.e. change, an attribute that not only makes the humans vulnerable but also gives them the hope to rise after a fall. 

The story focuses on a senile warlord, who owing to his senescence is rapidly losing his strength and his ferocious grandeur that he had earned through years of relentless savagery and ruthless slaughter, ergo he renounces to his three sons, hoping them to establish a sort of a triumvirate with the eldest son having a slight edge. His two elder sons accept the proposal with rapturous glee, but his youngest son seems bemused and questions the wits of the patriarch for taking the untimely decision. Though arrantly annoyed by his son's audacious defiance, he tries to console him, only to find him inconsolable. Deeply hurt by his son's impertinence and censure, he reluctantly banishes him and enthrones the two elder sons. The rest is rather worth a watch than a read, for there is nothing that can better the sumptuous elegance of Ran. 

The brilliantly captured scenes are breathtaking to say the least, especially the war scene that depicts fate casting the final blow to the ruthless reign of the warlord. The brutality and the bloodshed depicted in the very scene can make even a cold-blooded appear jittery. Ran portrays the poetic justice in such a relentless and abominable fashion that one can't help but sympathize with the narcissistic warlord, who spent his life arrogating and annihilating the innocent souls. The plaintive score gives the movie a much desired tone, a mood that not only supports its melancholic backdrop, but also immensely adds to its poignant beauty. The final scene featuring the blind boy, deeply clutched by his haplessness and gross solitude, though doesn't feature an utterance of even a single syllable, the playback of the mystical flute makes the scene haunting as well as mesmerising and worth a thousand words. Ran is a classic example of Kurosawa's brilliance and perhaps a consummation of his apotheosis. 

A must watch for eclectic viewers and admirers of pristine cinema. Highly recommended: 10/10.",2H42M

It is music, undeniably, it is watching MTV in the mid eighties through a dirty window in a smoke filled room with an obese man dancing and singing along. It is an event, a living process and a benevolent cultural tumor. See it. Allow it. Learn.

I grew aware of a certain truth that is unrelated to reality. The truth of a person. Tom Waits is an instrument of himself. He has fashioned a persona that is so real, and simultaneously so fantastical that it cannot be fraudulent. His presence is haunting, human entirely aware and yet still skewed. His music is that of perspectives. Each note, of each strange instrument carries its own voice. The collective whole does not then become an singly integrated piece but a turbulent chorus of voices and desires. It's as though the instruments are arguing about which direction they are going and in their argument become the songs, the melodies, as though they had no intention of doing so but happened to.

Usually what that means in cases like this is that it made me cry. 

The hook is that it reviews its subject through the eyes of the astronauts. I was wary of this. I got involved in the program later, during the beginning of the shuttle era and even then the astronauts were pretty much there only to have been taken there. They were chosen  some of them  for how good they looked on newsprint. 

The magic of the program and its heroes were a few visionaries and an army of competent engineers. 

Yet it was effective because we see the story through the eyes of witnesses. There role here is simply as witness, and if you were alive during this time, you will be impressed at how it affects you.

There were all sorts of paths that could have been followed in this. The quest of man to explore; the mysteries of the unknown; the vast game being played by two enemies to demonstrate superiority of ideology; the hidden weapons programs.

They cover all these slightly except that last, and that's excusable because these witnesses saw none of that. But the story that dominates is the Kennedy one. Its hard to imagine today, but we loved our president and he deserved it. He was intelligent and articulate. His advisers came off not as louts or bullies, but men (and a few women) smart enough for difficult times. He was the Peace Corps president. 

Kennedy promised to go to the moon and return without consulting anyone at NASA, and riding on the crest of a national enthusiasm for science and hardware. The nation really was engaged. And then he was killed, and with our rising self-doubt (Vietnam, race) we decided that as a people we owed it to him, or what he stood for. So when it happened, and the world watched, re affirmed the man and what he stood for. It was a good feeling, not pride as much as wonder about who we discovered ourselves to be.

This will evoke that same feeling again, the original tears, followed by tears of disappointment at the massive collapse of esteem which followed. A serious of botched opportunities to be worthy of the accomplishment.

Its an effective documentary in that regard, all the more so since everything was designed to be photographed, and was. If you really want to learn of this program, you need to go elsewhere, But this delivers on the promise.

I love his way of saying ""Junior!"", always gets me in a good chuckle. Harrison Ford still has that same Indy charm that swoons the ladies, the adventure that captivates the guys and takes us on an incredible journey that we'll never forget.

In 1938, Indiana finally recovers the Cross and donates it to his friend Marcus Brody's museum. Indiana is later taken to the residence of wealthy businessman Walter Donovan, who informs him that his father has vanished while searching for the Holy Grail, leaving behind partial directions from an incomplete stone tablet along with his diary containing his life's work on the Grail. Indiana and Marcus travel to Venice to investigate Henry's disappearance, meeting up with his colleague Elsa Schneider. Discovering catacombs beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indiana and Elsa find the tomb of Sir Richard, a knight of the First Crusade who is buried with a complete version of the tablet. Indiana finds his father, only to be betrayed by Elsa, who reveals that she and Donovan are working with the Nazis to find the Grail. The Nazis steal the Grail diary and capture Marcus in Iskenderun, where he was sent with pages from the diary to seek the protection of Sallah. The Joneses manage to escape the castle and follow the Nazis to Berlin, where they recover the diary from Elsa. The Joneses, Marcus and Sallah arrive to find that the Nazis are unable to pass through three ""trials"" of God. After Indy's father gets shot, he doesn't have much of a choice as to pass the trials and choose the correct cup to save his father's life.

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is one of my favorite movies of all time, it's just a flawless movie that will always be timeless. My future kids will watch these movies, they're just a lot of fun. Who said archeology can't be fun? This also has one of the most exciting chase scenes of all time, Indiana is trying to rescue his father and a friend from a Nazi tank and he is on a horse, a brutal fight ensues and was just so exciting to watch. I've watched this movie since I was a little girl and I still watch it with pleasure today, even with my friends we love watching Indiana and his adventures.

That's where they dress up however they like, strut their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on. We get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other. As one man says to another--""You have three strikes against you--you're black, gay and a drag queen"". These are people who (sadly) are not accepted in society--only at the balls. There they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted. Then the film cuts to three years later (1989) and you see how things have changed (tragically for some). 

Sounds depressing but it's not. Most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations. They're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor--just as they should. We find out they all live in ""houses"" run by various ""mothers"" and all help each other out. The sense of community in this film is fascinating.

When this film came out in 1990 it was controversial--and a big hit. It won Best Documentary Awards at numerous festivals--but was never even nominated for an Academy Award. Their reason was ""Black and hispanic drag queens are not Academy material"". Fascinating isn't it? Homophobia and racism all together. 

Seen today it's still a great film--and a period piece. It just isn't like that anymore--the NY they show no longer exists. The balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here. Also drag has become more ""accepted"" in society (for better or worse). And I've heard the houses are gone too. That's kind of sad. I WOULD like to know where these characters are now--I know two died of AIDS but I have no idea about the others. And what DID happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown?

It seems there is a delay from the time the newest episode is first aired/ released in the UK and when the USA sees and may purchase it.)

The Up Series (7 Up, Seven Plus Seven, 21 Up, 28 Up, 35 Up, 42 Up, 49 Up and most recently in 2012, 56 Up) is one of the most interesting, remarkable social documentaries ever presented. I screen all episodes every year, and each time, I see new things, learn more.

For me, the two most remarkable and worthy persons profiled are Neil Hughes and Bruce Balden, neither married or materially ""successful"" by the 1991 ""35 Up"" episode, both badgered about that on camera by the off camera interviewer, both stoic and dignified in the face of the negative evaluation the interviewer provides.

Neither man, Hughes or Balden, led conventional, predictable, profitable, ""safe"" lives. Both opted for exploration, adventure, and service to and comradeship with socially unprestigious groups and persons.

Both took enormous chances, and must be accounted brave, noble men for that alone. They didn't ""play it safe."" Both exude an intelligence and a willingness to discuss difficult questions and issues in detail on camera, and neither attack the show they appear on, the thoughtless, implicitly insulting interviewer, or the show's and interviewer's obvious prejudices and agenda for the show itself as a piece of social and political propaganda.

Balden and Hughes use the riveting show as a platform to describe their own lives, ideals, and activities in pursuit of those ideals, activities not supported by outside big money or generous support from family, government, or other sources.

We learn more about the world at the times the episodes are presented (every 7 years starting in 1963.....the most recent one in 2004) from observing and listening to the words and ideas of Bruce Balden and Neil Hughes by far than is true of the other children and adults presented, none of whom departed from the settings where they first appeared at age 7 in 1963.

It's an interesting show, and less spectacular careers and worlds of the children/ adults who traveled different, more predictable and conventional paths than Bruce Balden and Neil Hughes are worth noting and following.

This show began in the middle 1960's as a hatchet job attacking upper class people and decrying poverty in lower social classes, clearly had an agenda supporting the liberal, socialist values and ideals popular and aggressive in the 1960's.

The times changed, but the show has gone on, and it's value is enormous.

No pin-point accuracy with 19th century technology, no desire to 'play fair' and face the enemy on even terms.  If you can shoot him in the back...then do it.

Eastwood puts in an astonishing performance as the retired killer Muny, saved from his life of thievery and murder by his late wife.  Now, desperately trying to support his children with no income, he is tempted back to his killing ways by the bounty offered by the women of a brothel, one of whom's number has been savagely beaten and disfigured by a drunken ranch-hand.

The film follows Eastwood as he wrestles with his desire to honour his wife's memory and his need to feed his children by returning to the killer that, he fears, is his true nature.  Meanwhile word of the bounty has spread and the events spiral out of control as the sheriff (Gene Hackman) deals with the guns for hire that ride into town.

While all the supporting cast are excellent Gene Hackman's Oscar winning performance even manages to eclipse Eastwoods as the brutal Sheriff. He beats one of the bounty hunters, English Bob (Richard Harris) almost to death and then explains to a journalist, in one of the film's stand out scenes, how men like he and Muny are so successful at killing. The mood moves from light banter to life threatening seriousness...and back again, with just one move of his head.

One of the greatest Westerns ever made?  Certainly. Although the fact it's a western is really secondary.  In truth it's a tale of the nature of evil and the nature of man.  Eastwood uses the gap between the western myth and reality as an arena to play out his story and does so with consummate style.",2H10M

It was to me some of the best television to grace my television set. 'Prime Suspect II' was every bit as good, the two are about equal in terms of quality, for the same reasons as before.

'Prime Suspect III' was watched with high expectations when seeing all the 'Prime Suspect' series over-time since reviewing the first series last year. Those expectations were not just met but also surpassed. It has all the things that made the previous two 'Prime Suspect' series so great, and stands out even more because of the characterisation which was even richer and because of the story and its heavier themes than before.

It is stylishly and cleverly filmed, with slick editing and atmospheric lighting, and there is a consistently wonderful atmosphere throughout. It is a dark and gritty atmosphere, 'Prime Suspect' in general is both those things story-wise and visually but 'Prime Suspect III' is one of the stronger examples, while also being effectively claustrophobic. It is very hard to forget the music score too. The scripting, like its predecessor, is some of the best there is of any mystery/detective drama, being superbly constructed and intelligent.

The story is 'Prime Suspect' at its darkest, most hard-hitting and grittiest for the intense subject matter alone, but in some ways also at its most honest, intricate and emotional. It is a complex story that keeps one guessing right up to the end while also being easy to follow. The interrogation scenes are some of the most harrowing of the whole 'Prime Suspect' franchise, both intensely shocking and even brings tears to the eyes.

Jane Tennison continues to be an interesting character, the character and the depiction of the police force was very ahead of the time back in the 90s and holds much fascination now even if not so novel.

Helen Mirren gives a typically magnificent performance in the lead, and she has one of her best supporting casts of all the 'Prime Suspect' series that include Peter Capaldi and Mark Strong in early roles and a standout turn from Tom Bell as oily Sergeant Otley. Excelling also are David Thewlis, who has never been more thuggish, and Ciaran Hinds at his most mysterious.

In conclusion, along with the previous two 'Prime Suspect' series, 'Prime Suspect III' is the franchise at its best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It successfully combines official footage, animation and a naturally harrowing storyline that keeps you engrossed, even though you know how it's going to end.

The film is replete with moving interviews with the astronauts, their families and the scientists who worked on the mission.  (One notable omission is the absence of Jack Swigert, the command module pilot, who died of cancer in 1982.  Odd that that is not noted anywhere in the movie or the credits.)

One of the best parts is the footage of and subsequent interviews years later with the ground controllers who had to solve the impossible problem of how to get the men back with limited air, water and electricity.  The explanations are technical but still quite understandable to the layman. It's fascinating to view them saving the flight when most of them were only in their late 20s!  And to see them get choked up when remembering the event 20 years later shows the human sides of even the most rugged technicians and administrators.

It's a valuable bit of history and is a testament to human resiliency, ingenuity, and most of all the human spirit.  As the narration says at the end, ""Apollos 8, 11 and 13 brought us together in ways we never expected.""",1H22M

Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese's most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese's direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don't seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem.",2H58M

The plot starts out simple : a space waste collection crew receive a mysterious SOS signal, and set out to attempt a rescue mission. But what they discover exceeds their wildest expectations, and the operation spirals out of control.

The short's ambiance is allegedly inspired by Ridley Scott's Alien, and the story by Katsuhiro Ohtomo is reminiscent of other SF classics when it approaches the psychology of dreams (Solyaris) and the dangers of AI (2001), but it also approaches the subject of virtual reality in a unique and interesting way. This might seem like an odd mish-mash, but in the end it all fits together perfectly.

The thick and menacing ambiance in this short is helped by beautiful, fluid animation of a rare caliber and an excellent soundtrack that deftly combines Madame Butterfly (a story element) with electronic ambiances and its own instrumental score. Once again, Yoko Kanno delivers a masterful composition.

I'm normally not a fan of Japanese animation, but this soars above the anime landscape in terms of quality and attention to detail. In fact, after having re-watched it, it's become a favorite of mine in the realm of SF. Magnetic Rose is published as part of the compilation ""Memories"", but I preferred to review it by itself.",45M

This was his first ""big"" concert for the Home Box Office and it did deserve the Emmeys it got because it is very well written and will cause laughter to ensue every minute!

Rock wisely mixes his vulgar words along with his political views and general beliefs, thus, allowing each act to have a message behind it as well as the punchline getting executed 'no problem.'

While he is incredibly similar to his idol's Richard Pryor, George Carlin and Eddie Murphy, Chris relies less on ""shock value"" and doesn't repeat himself as often as other comedians do.

The contemporary director has a curious fascination with the sort of characters so often sidelined by Turkish filmmakers eager to show their country at its best and this comes through in his use of language, somewhat lost in subtitle translation, and the carefully woven back-story, which inspired a prequel, that drive this compelling film forward.

I knew nothing about the story until the first two hour film was shown on TV (October 7th in England.-I hear that the USA will get the Hornblower series in the New Year) There are four Hornblower films, and the first 'The Even Chance' made me want to see the other three right away! The story is set in the years of the Napoleonic wars, and the first story shows Hornblowers first adventures as midshipman aboard the' Indefatigable'' having to put up with bullying by Simpson another midshipman aboard the ship who takes an instant dislike to the new recuit. The acting by Ioan Gruffudd as the young, self-concious, shy Horatio Hornblower is superb, and his dark brooding good looks are sure to make him a new heart throb. The rest of the cast are brilliant too, from Robert Lindsay as captain Pellew to Dorian Healy as the vicious Simpson. The £12 million spent on the film, has not gone to waste either. The first wooden ship to be built for 140 years, 'The Grand Turk', is used in the film for the 'Indefatigable' and is a stunning sight to see. The action sequences are brilliantly done, making you feel like you are almost on the ship itself. So brilliant action sequences, wonderful battle ships, and a stunning cast, all make Hornblower one of the best things to come on TV in years. Luckily for me (now a huge Hornblower fan) the showing of the second film-which was to be in December- has been put forward to November, because of the huge number of people calling ITV Television station, saying how much they liked it, and demanding for it to be put on early!

The subjects are interviewed as to the changes that...",1998-07-21,"twin towers,london england,lifespan,lifespan development,politics",8.2,Philby-3,2001-06-17,"Fourteen English children from various parts of society, all born about 1957, have their lives looked at every seven years by Michael Apted and his TV camera. This episode brings us up to 1999 and 42 years old. All are still alive and eleven out of the original fourteen are still participating. (Ironically, one of the drop-outs is a prominent BBC TV producer.)

 The two continuing themes are 1) the Jesuit saying `give me the child before he is seven and I will give you the man' and 2) the power of the British class system to determine outcomes. Although the Jesuits suggest that by the age of seven it's too late, some of the kids from lower class backgrounds have done surprisingly well. Nicholas, a Yorkshire dales farmer's son has become a Professor of Physics. Tony, a cockney kid who wanted to be a jockey has finished up owning several cabs. Three working class girls have all finished up with better jobs than their parents though their marital relationships have been rocky. Even the shy son of a single mother has finished up happily married and employed. None of the better-off kids has failed either, though one or two went through rough patches in their early 20s. The three seven year old `upper class twits' (only one of whom still participates in the program) are all professionals and have all succeeded professionally - a QC, a solicitor and the aforesaid shy TV producer. Bruce, a kid with a flair for mathematics, after a varied career, has settled down as a fine teacher in a city high school. They only real stray has been Neil, the dreamy little kid from Liverpool, who after a lengthy period as a down-and-out has popped up as an elected official no less, a Liberal Democrat councillor in the London Borough of Hackney. 

All the subjects tell their stories fairly fluently to the camera, even Paul, a very shy kid who migrated to Australia as a teenager. Several have now lost one or both parents and there have been several failed marriages. Apted is a gentle interviewer but there has obviously been a lot of pain with the gain.

This is a unique series and the group is not really a random sample (too many toffs and working class kids) but it can be said it shows the persistence of the class system: only one kid has really beaten it, the physicist, and he's left the country. There are no cockney accents in the courtroom except from the witness box. The standard of living in general has increased markedly since the 1960s and `trickle down' economics has ensured that the working class (what's left of them) is better off. Women have done better too, in terms of independence and money, but at a considerable emotional cost in some cases. For them the changes in the social landscape have made it harder than for the boys; the role of women in society has completely changed whereas men plod on much as before.

The one good indicator of future employment success is education, which is notoriously class-based in England (Scotland is a little different). If the (shy) QC had gone to the local council school instead of Charterhouse it is not likely he would he exercising his tonsils today in the High Court. Tony, our successful cabbie might have become a solicitor if he had come from a different social class. Some of the subjects say that class isn't what it was, but it, and the educational system it operates through, are still pre-ordaining outcomes. Perhaps it's the same in most countries (Paul has noticed a class system in Australia); it's just that the British class system stands out a bit more.",2H19M

Also, the sad fact that some people unfortunately have to leave their homes and move abroad is another major issue of this movie.

 Another success of the director is that, the scenes spend a lot of time with the Christmas time. But it never gets boring.

Like a book you will remember for your lifetime, like a painting that you can never erase from your mind, like a song that comes to your head at least once a day, everyday. 

The director has blended Kathakali and Indian Mythology into the storyline like milk and honey and the product is a treat to the senses. No words to describe Zakir Hussain's score and Santosh Sivan's camera..They just elevate the movie to a totally different level. The message that Dance is a form of self-expression has been very elegantly and poignantly told in the film, yet, there is a subtlety about every aspect in the movie that gives you something more in each and every frame than what actually is conveyed in each scene. The actors are tailor-made for their roles, with Mohanlal giving an almost flawless performance. He plays the role of Kunhikuttan with the right body language, emotions and expressions. He is impressive in those scenes where his dialogues are few because the actor knows just how to speak with his facial expressions. Suhasini as Subhadra is perfect with her performance. 

The movie does not have a narrator yet you can sense a mute voice narrating the life of Kunhikuttan. This is primarily due to the acting and the Background score which deserve a lot of acclamation. After watching the movie you sense a deep heavy feeling which leaves a lasting impression on you. The story can very well be summed up in a line, but it is a lot more. The movie is slow-paced and rightly so because it also tells you that nothing happens suddenly in life. There are always a series of events leading to every minute of your life. And the life of Kunhikuttan is explained thus. At the end, you cannot help but wonder at the poignant performance, the message you never knew was being sent and yet you perceive all this in a span of 2 hours.

With only a father and a grandmother left in his family, he looks forward to summer with them once school has finished. Mohammad is full of life even though he cannot see and is constantly exploring with his hands and his grandmother loves him for this. His father is a different story and wants Mohammad out of the way so that he can remarry in an arranged ceremony with a woman who doesn't know about his son. However his plan to send Mohammad far away on an apprenticeship brings him directly into conflict with his son's grandmother.

A popular choice for the Oscars in 2000, this film has developed this success and has garnered quite an audience as a result. The story is quite an emotionally involving one that is better than the basic description of the narrative suggests because this is driven by our sympathy/empathy for the characters involved. As such it works pretty well as it is easy to relate to the emotions of all of the lead three characters  even the bitterness of the father was something that could be understood and felt for, at no point was he simply a bad guy for feeling what he did. At times the story gets a bit too steeped in meaningful sentiment but for the majority it is a well observed and patient story that is quite touching at points.

The acting is a big factor in this working as well as it did. Ramezani is the most obvious one to praise and indeed he is praiseworthy for making his character real and convincing while never letting it become a ""cute kid part"" as so many brats can't help but do  he may have been drawing on things within himself but this is still a very real performance. Mahjoub is as good for the very reason that he keeps us caring about his character even if what he is feeling is not anything we can condone. Feizi's grandmother is an unremarkable character but she delivers it well with a solid, if unimaginative, portrayal and performance. The support cast are also strong but it was the lead three that made it what it was. The direction is good, sharing an eye for detail and little daily realities with a talent for the bigger landscapes.

Overall this is an impressive and enjoyable film that is beautiful to look at and has plenty to engage the heart. It may be a bit ""up itself"" at a few points but these are few and far between and the majority of the film succeeds thanks to well written characters and actors who deliver with an apparent good understanding of their characters.",1H30M

3 days later I had my money ready to buy all three dvds, which was gonna set me back ninety dollars. Psh. 2 episodes a DVD. So why is it worth only 89.99 of that ninety? The booklet and subtitles. The subtitles are the LITERAL translations from Japanese, while the actual dubbing is superb and fits well in overall. It would have been nice though to have the captions from what I was really hearing. The booklets are kinda hit and miss because they made a mistake in the first one and ""made up"" for it in the second one spending over 3 pages with some boring talking about stuff that people in general just don't care about.

A self-help guide which applies the teachings of philosophers to dealing with life's everyday problems.,2000-03-26,"philosopher,tv mini series,happiness,philosophy",8.2,rmax304823,2012-06-22,"Alain de Botton, a balding young Englishman, thoroughly educated and cosmopolitan, is your host and he takes you on a kind of journey through selected corners of European philosophy in an attempt to find nuggets of wisdom that will help you overcome your hang ups. There are six episodes.

1. Socrates on Self Confidence.

2. Epicurus on Happiness.

3. Seneca on Anger.

4. Montaigne on Self Esteem.

5. Schopenhauer on Love.

6. Nietzsche on Hardship.

De Botton takes us on a tour of places where these light thinkers lived and shows us around, but it's not a survey course in the history of philosophy. De Botton is interested in finding out if these people had anything to say to us, miserable wretches that we are. Never mind metaphysics -- what do I do NOW, Ma? 

Does it work? Is there anything still useful in their output? Maybe. I suppose it depends on the individual and, of course, to some extent on what the philosophers actually had to say about issues of current concern. Some certainly work better than others. I'll give an example of one that seems to work and one that doesn't.

One that may sometimes work: Nietzsche's message to today's viewers can be summarized in the phrase, ""Whatever does not kill me makes me stronger."" In other words, how to overcome hardship? Get used to it. Well, it evidently worked for G. Gordon Liddy, who was fond of using the quote, but psychologists have come up with mixed results. (Full disclosure: I am a psychologist.) A difficult and humiliating initiation rite leads to greater solidarity in the group, which is generally good, although it depends on the group's goal. That's why, ""Once a Marine, always a Marine."" Nobody ever says, ""Once a Coast Guardsman, always a Coast Guardsman."" On the other hand, combat may not kill you but it may induce post-traumatic stress disorder, which is very real, take my word for it. The treatment, stress, can be worse than the disease of weakness.

Okay, one that did work, for me at least -- Seneca on anger. Why do we get angry? Because we expect too much, that's why. Lower your expectations and you won't be disappointed and therefore you won't be angry. The scientific literature generally supports this, although people with low expectations usually have all sorts of associated problems that extend way beyond just getting angry. I tried it myself, with the stock market. Each morning before logging into my account, I make an estimate of how much I've lost or how little I've gained. I always try to be very conservative. And actually it appears to have helped, at least in this limited area. Anger was never a problem but I find I'm less often disappointed and more often cheered when I check my balances. I'm tempted to see just how far this governance of attitude can be taken. Maybe I should just assume that the very act of my purchasing a stock is the kiss of death. Then, no matter how much I lose, as long as the company doesn't go bankrupt, my expectations are more than met. How about if I assume that when I wake up tomorrow I'll find that I died during the night? How can you lose? 

My advice is to check this out. Nothing much is going to help you if you have a clinical-level illness, but if you're subject to everyday hassles and find them more annoying than they should be, a constant irritation, why not try it? These guys should know. Socrates had an abundance of self esteem. He lectured his executioners from his death bed.",

This is all obvious to anyone who has had an unbiased, detailed education of that dreadful time period. On the surface, Jiang Wen's film touches on these acts to illuminate what it must have been like for the Chinese to cope with the Japanese ""devils"". But a thorough viewing of the film reveals so many more questions not just about the Chinese and Japanese but about the universal relationship between war and humans. Wen directs this film in a peculiar way. He uses comedy that forces us to laugh at things that we shouldn't. You find yourself smirking or smiling in moments until you catch yourself and remember that the whole scene in which you were laughing at was where character's lives were at stake. Most people will read this and not see what is so masterful about this approach. What makes Wen's quirkiness work is that it illuminates the naivety of human beings while at the same time brings these characters to life, which in the end leaves us trembling with emotion.

I've only seen one other ""contemplative film"" which is Angelopoulos' Ulyssey's Gaze, which I deeply cherish.  This didn't get to me as deeply as it's images weren't as evocative to me.  This is probably due to my being able access the cultural symbols of Angelopoulos more easily (though that film isn't ""easy"" either,it's just that I have more background in modern Greek poetry, etc.).

It is drawn in the same way (or similar at least) as the first 4 OVA episodes were (American title: Samurai X), which is in a realistic (as realistic as anime gets...) and beautiful way.

There is not much action to be found in Seisouhen, instead it is very emotional (I actually shed a tear or two) and it is a beautiful finish to it all.

In conclusion: if you have seen some of the TV series and seen the other 4 OVA episodes (Samurai X) this is something you will not and cannot miss. If not, watching Seisouhen will be a complete waste of time for you.",

We knew in general what had happened, that there was a coup, that Nicolae Ceausescu was executed, etc, but not many people here really knew what happened. There was a lot of confusion, misinformation and general lack of any in depth coverage as to what was really happening at the time. National Public Radio provided the most in depth coverage, but even they didn't quite get the whole thing when it was actually happening. Mostly likely because of things like media blackouts, competing propaganda, etc. This movie shows far more than anything I ever saw reported here. This has just been released by Facets video and I was able to rent it on DVD via Netflix.

Americans might dismiss this sort of thing as old Soviet era cold war communist events that could only happen then and in those places, and while nothing comes close to this sort of revolution in the West, there are hints of that here, and that is scary. The basic issues of who controls the media are still there in both cases, omnipresent police at demonstrations, tanks in the street, like Los Angeles last year, the ignorance of the elite and refusal to recognize the common peoples problems, lies, counter lies, allegiances and loyalty, the military allegiance to > the people or the president?....Does the recent US military (retired) generals criticism of Donald Rumsfeld ring a bell?

Yep, it's pretty complicated stuff folks,and this film shows it all.It should be required viewing for all young people everywhere. Why? Because it serves as a reminder of what can happen when too many people become unhappy. It reminds people of how delicate many situations are around the world, even today. How easily a situation can deteriorate unless leaders are mighty careful.

I'm online in some discussion groups with people in Romania and nearby Slovenia and surrounding countries. In many areas, much of this was carried live in the region, but not everything. As the films shows, there were media blackouts. That's true indeed.

This will take some time, but I believe that the subtitles made for the DVD are not quite complete....We think they can be improved to get a better understanding. I'm working with my Romanian friends who do remember this and do know English to maybe eventually send Facets video a nice time stamped text file. Maybe they can release an updated second edition. After all, it should be the Romanians themselves who see this documentary and help the world better understand what happened via the English text/subtitles or any other language. It's their history, and by extension, everybody's history.

also, none of my friends in Romania recognize this video as being widely available there. We're working on getting them a copy.

Outstanding documentary, I give it a 9.0

Mostly it's because this documentary shows,like no other I have seen, how a huge number of people can turn, on the edge of a pin

I was lucky enough to see the Broadway production of Angels with the original cast, and it was without question the highlight of my 25 years of theatre-going. While I prefer the stage version over the film (I usually do), Nichol's film does an outstanding job of capturing the brilliance of Kushner's script.

Personally, I believe that Pacino gives the performance of his career, and Streep is amazing in her three roles. The other performances are quite solid as well.

This film not only won a record 11 Emmys, taking the award for Outstanding Miniseries and all four acting trophies, it also won those same awards at the Golden Globe presentations plus four SAG acting awards. In short, it won practically every award it possibly could.

Helen Mirren is possibly at her best in ""6"" as the ageing senior detective, constantly battling the establishment as she tries to manage a big caseload when a particularly brutal murder opens a Pandora's box of leads, lies and loose ends.

My prize, however, goes to Peter Berry for his writing.  The story lets us slowly explore the minds, motivations and especially the passions of all the main characters and makes good use of historical events and present-day tensions to construct a drama of the highest quality.

A couple of the patients seem hopeless from the outset, the others start out fairly vibrant but gradually deteriorate into despair, resignation, and finally barely functional bodies. Although we see them at their most helpless and dependent, at the height of their suffering, the feeling aroused is not pity but heartfelt compassion for them and their loved ones. Most moving of all is Lloyd, whose brain tumor leaves him practically speechless, but the devotion of his lover is deeply affecting. A powerful, shattering piece of work.",2H28M

As a raving fan of Miyazaki and of Diana Wynne Jones, I feel lucky to be an American living in France -- I see there's no release date announced yet for the U.S. Sorry, folks, and blame Disney! 

I understand the feelings of viewers who have criticized the movie as trite. I find it's less imaginative, in terms of character development and emotional profundity, than Miyazaki's best masterpieces. However, even a pedestrian Miyazaki movie is infinitely more rich, frightening, imaginative and humane than any six Disney films put together, and there's a lot to love in ""Howl's Moving Castle."" 

I am glad I didn't reread Jones' book before seeing the film; even going on my six-year-old memory of the novel, I can see the movie's a very loose adaptation, and I think Jones fans would do best to try to take the movie on its own merits instead of looking for a faithful adaptation. That said, Miyazaki is surprisingly successful, at moments, in capturing the richness of the novel's characters: the peculiar co-habitation of charm and terror in Howl the sorcerer and his demon companion Calcifer, and the pragmatic strength of will that makes us love Sophie, the protagonist, who embodies both the fairy-tale archetypes of the young girl and the old woman at once.

Miyazaki's directorial trademarks are here in spades. Most of them lend strength and power to the film: his passion for open landscapes, his vision of the power and horror of war, the uncompromised way his movies work to empower children, and especially girls. A few of them are just Miyazaki quirks that fans will recognize with amusement (walrus mustaches, cobbled European squares, and flying machines for everyone!) Richer and stranger, though, are the very successful integration of two things that Disney animation never even approaches: the way even a children's story can blur lines between an enemy and a friend, and the cohabitation of the monstrous and the sublime. Enemy, ally, monster, beloved: Miyazaki gives both visual and moral weight to these disturbing contradictions, and certain scenes in ""Howl's Moving Castle"" evoke a frightening sublimity I have never seen elsewhere than in ""Princess Mononoke."" 

I think the film suffers from a slightly hurried pace, especially with respect to the protagonists' character development, and the result is a loss of the subtlety that makes Jones' book such a gripping fairy tale. Her Howl is more ambivalent, and her story is a more complex investigation of adolescent heartlessness and the growth of the heart. The ending, which falls back too much on clichéd imagery and deus-ex-machina, also could have been better handled. All that said, ""Howl's Moving Castle"" contains lots of treasures and will, I think, stand up to repeated viewings. Miyazaki fans will be delighted, and kids around the world should be given the chance to taste this latest rich, respectful children's tale. (Be warned, though: there are moments as terrifying as those in ""Princess Mononoke,"" and younger kids will need their parents with them.) 

On a final note, as few hardcore fans of Japanese anime will need to be reminded, the movie is doubtless best seen in its original version with subtitles. The Japanese voice acting is terrific -- although the voice of ""young Sophie"" doesn't strike me as anything special, the actors playing the aged Sophie, Howl, and especially Calcifer are fantastic. Calcifer is a magnificent creation and should delight even the most conservative fan of the novel. I have serious doubts that the inevitable English-language dub will do the nuances justice.",1H59M

I have never seen a film picturing the insanity of Hitler in his very last days in a bunker in Berlin with his high command, and how the German people were hypnotized by him like in this film. Last year, I saw the deceptive, boring, pretentious and overrated ""Molokh"", showing a caricature of Hitler and Eva Braun in Bavaria. But ""Der Untergang"" is awesome and comparable to ""Apocalypse Now!"", my favorite movie of war.

Two years ago, I saw the powerful ""Das Experiment"" and I was impressed with the work of Oliver Hirschbiegel. With ""Der Untergang"", this director is certainly included in my list of favorite directors. It is difficult to highlight one actor or actress in this constellation of stars, but I was impressed with the performance of Bruno Ganz and his ""human"" Hitler, totally different from the stereotypes usual in other movies. The cinematography and the battles are stunning, and the scenario of Berlin completely destroyed recalled the neo-realistic movie of Roberto Rossellini ""Germania Anno Zero"".

For those who know Germany and German people, it is amazing to see how this wonderful country survived to the chaos, destruction and lack of command, arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. For those who might have believed in Hitler and his Nazi Party, it is impressive to see how people is forgotten and treated without compassion by their leader in his last hours. And for those who love war, I really recommend to watch this magnificent anti-war movie, and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost. My vote is ten.

The news over the car radio was enough for us to pause for several minutes as we digested the enormity of the event. There have been several good documentaries on TV or in the movie houses about the death of Martin Luther King. I think that this is the best one I have seen. We were lucky enough to have one of the directors to hold a Q&A session after the screening at the Auckland Int'l Film Festival this year; I asked him the question ""Did you just think of the title as an apt one or did you think of its correlation to ""Citizen Kane"" and also another movie ""Citizen Cohn""...about Roy Cohn""?"" The director, Nolan Walker, spoke eloquently about the correlation and said that MLK was not only a citizen of the USA but was a citizen of the world and that he tried his best to improve the world. I think the majority would agree with that. The film was very well edited, with a lot of the major players in the years prior to 1968 taking part in the movie, although Coretta did not take part. It dealt, fairly and well, with the controversial parts of King's life, such as his womanising. The packed audience was enthralled by the documentary and by Nolan Walker's eloquence afterwards.",

I went in with low expectations, despite the excellence of Christopher Nolan's previous efforts. Talk about having your expectations confounded! This film grips like wet rope from the start. I won't give away any of the story; suffice to say it mixes and matches its sources freely, tossing in a dash of Frank Miller, a bit of Alan Moore and a pinch of Bob Kane to great effect. 

What's impressive is that despite the weight of the franchise, Nolan has managed to work so many of his trademarks into a mainstream movie. The story does not progress in linear fashion for the first half, and there are some truly spectacular hallucination scenes. Parents thinking of taking their young kids along, think twice. When we left, a terrified 8-year-old boy was being comforted by his parents. Some of what's up there on screen really is the stuff of nightmares.

Of the cast of Brits chosen to bring this American tale to the masses, Christian Bale convinces in his dual role, while Michael Caine as Alfred comes up with the humour just when the film is in danger of taking itself too seriously. Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson provide able support, as does Morgan Freeman. 

Most refreshing of all is the way that Nolan and co have come up with a way of bringing comics to the screen that does justice to the often adult source material in a way that, say, Daredevil, tried and failed to do (although the director's cut is better). If the Dark Knight doesn't return after this, there's no justice.",2H20M

It is brilliantly scripted, made and executed, and it is also profound and complex. Many have called it a pretentious show, and indeed, that's something very obvious and annoying. I'm sure Bhansali from the very outset had planned to get many awards, five-star reviews, and ""the-best-filmmaker-in-the-country"" titles, but that said, nobody can completely begrudge him since this movie is as impressive and well-invested as it is ostentatious, and it deserves the hype. Let's start with saying that technically and visually Black is a treat. It boasts of fantastic sets and wonderful costumes, and the cinematography is incredibly good. All these, along with the superb background score, create a beautifully dark film. Having said that, this may be the exact reason why many viewers found it hard to relate to, and that's something I can easily understand, particularly after having seen his best feature to date, Khamoshi: The Musical, in which everything was kept simple. Here there's no simplicity: everything is lavish, big, grandiose - and that's why it's often labelled pretentious. The film is emotional yet unsentimental, which is good, but then, one of its main flaws is the fact that more than once it resorts to emotional manipulation, trying to forcibly wring tears.

Well, one thing is sure and it is that you can always expect good acting in a SLB film, particularly when it has an Amitabh Bachchan. Bachchan's performance is out of this world. His character goes through many phases, and each time you feel he's sinking into it more and more, so much that no words can be found to describe it. Seeing an actor of his calibre still being there, and playing a part with such passion, intensity, emotion, anger and hunger, makes one believe that the sky is the limit. Along with Yuva, Hum Tum and Veer-Zaara, Black is a film that constructs Rani Mukherjee's transformation from an average performer to a mature actress. She plays the character brilliantly. The scene which had her crying on the phone to her mom, is one of her career-best acts. It's cruel that she is cast opposite Bachchan, as she can't take the whole credit to herself, and well, frankly speaking, in my view her role is not as powerful as his, as it is a technical part that requires extensive training rather than soul. It's still a memorable performance, and in her case, if the sky is the limit, Black was probably the sky. Without taking anything from Mukherjee, I was more impressed and amazed by the far more superior performance of Ayesha Kapur, who played the young Michelle to perfection. Kapur is simply flawless in this role.

Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a crafted filmmaker who knows his work and his goals very well. In spite of its flaws, Black remains artistic and it is overall a moving movie experience. The words hope, love, dedication and success always come to the mind while watching it. It might not be original, it may be extremely manipulative at points, but the effort that was put into it by the entire cast and crew is evident and appreciable. Black is definitely better than most of the films made in the Hindi film industry. Though for me too it is a mixed bag, I admit that the first time I saw it, I kept thinking of it after the show had ended and for quite some time. This is an achievement few films can achieve (for me), and here's why my high rating.",2H2M

This HBO documentary quickly covers the life and career of New York Yankees legend Mickey Mantle. Through archival footage we see his rise through the ranks of one of the greatest baseball players in history and then his after career, which included several bad times due to his heavy drinking. At just 60-minutes this documentary is way too short to really dig into who Mantle was but I think for the most part it's a highly entertaining and touching look at the legend. If parents want to introduce their kids to who Mantle was then this here is going to work perfectly because it quickly gets to the highlights of his baseball career, the star he became but it also ends with a pretty strong message about the way Mantle abused his body. Some of the most interesting aspects were the baseball footage, which was great because one can see Mantle playing. The footage was in pretty good shape and we also got a lot of other footage including commercials that Mantle did as well as various other forms of advertisements. Mantle's wife, sons, friends and former teammates are all interviewed about the man and we also get sports writers like Skip Bayless and Bob Costas as well as fans like Ed Harris and Billy Crystal.

But neither is it just another version of Big Brother. I personally found this unique project profoundly moving in its originality. Through this film we get a deep sense of the way humans adjust to their circumstances, maintain their personalities and shape their own lives around what they want and can have. I had a sense of the innate decency of most human beings, our capacity for love and survival, the way in which character runs deeper than circumstances, but also the strong effect that circumstances such as the class one is born into can have on us. Most of all I was touched by the unpredictability of life: it would have been hard to say whose marriages would last and whose would not, for example.

Having said that, it is unclear to me why so many of the subjects, who volunteer to take part in the filming, seem to fear and oppose it so much. As someone who would have loved the opportunity to revisit my own life at different stages, I have a hard time understanding the reasons for their reluctance and even hostility.",3H

Exploring the shared language and poetic sensibilities of all animals.",2005-03-05,"animal,cheetah,elephant,photographer,female frontal nudity",8.2,ed2oh9,2008-01-22,"I went to the opening of the Ashes & Snow exhibit when it arrived in Santa Monica, Ca. As the Nomadic Museum was being assembled (basically large cargo containers stacked upon one another), my friends and I thought it was going to be some sort of Cirgue De Soleil spin off, since that's what had been set up in the same spot the years before. We couldn't have been more wrong.

Just before the show opened, someone told me about the website (ashesandsnow.com). I was amazed by what I saw and couldn't wait for the show's opening. When the day finally came, I was mesmerized by each image as it hung in the immense gallery, which I think was designed to give you the sense of walking among elephants. Some of the images are so bold though, with the interaction between man and animal, that you start to believe that they were digitally manipulated. Then I walked into the center section of the gallery and saw the film. It was just as awe inspiring as the images and left no doubt that each image was captured as it the scenes were choreographed.

Being a photographer myself, I can say that the exposures, the compositions, the cinematography, the moods created, the toning, etc, were all absolutely perfect. I've been shooting for years and know how difficult it is to get EVERYTHING to work in coordination to create a memorable image. It's hard enough to get it all to work together in a controlled environment, but Gregory Colbert shot the majority of the images with animals. On top of that, he shot underwater, with whales, elephants and manatees, creating some of the most unique images I've ever seen.

Beyond the technical aspect of the film though is the incredible harmony that you see between man and animal. For one reader to suggest that the animals were ""in distress"" is absolutely ludicrous. You don't see that here. You also don't see animals that resemble circus creatures that have been beaten into submission. Instead, what you see is humans that live in peace with the animals from their native land. You see an incredible respect for the animals and a gentleness that put the animals at ease. It's a thing of beauty.

Deeper still is the message behind the film and the images. Both Laurence Fishburne and Ken Wantanabbe have the perfect voice to narrate Colbert's story of a man who left all that he knew, in order to find himself in distant lands. The revelations that he discovers along the way are what we get to see in the images that were produced. Watch the film, listen to the words, and then watch the film again, and again, and again. In it, you'll see a man's dreams, visions, heart break and redemption. You'll see the journey he took and the worlds that he saw, not only on the outside, but inwardly as well. You'll hear his message of love and see that ultimately, the film is not about animals at all...but instead about us.

It is a masterpiece, and it is an experience.",1H2M

The effortless transition between the real world and the underworld and the way the two worlds are interlinked really is something special and I've never seen it done as well before.

The combination of a convincing and easy to buy into storyline and the magical fantasy underworld works perfectly. The fact that both parts of the story could easily stand alone without the other, and yet go together seamlessly, is an indicator of just how good it is. The horror elements also bring something completely different and unexpected to the film, though they are tastefully added and never overdone.

Everyone was in great spirits with some pre-show Charles Nelson Reilly t-shirts being given away. Knowing that CNR was more than just a television perma-guest, I was looking forward to hearing him tell stories as only he can. He didn't disappoint. It takes a gifted storyteller to wring humor and pathos out of a painful childhood, and a sharp observer to make the life story so fresh and consistently surprising. As long as the cameras held steady on CNR and just let the man express himself, the film was excellent.

Unfortunately, it seemed that the film-makers wanted to constantly remind the viewer that this was a FILM documentary. I wanted to hear more stories, especially about his life in the theater, but the film-makers edited three-plus hours of stage material down to barely ninety minutes. This lead to some jarring transitions and title screens explaining what surely must have been great stories. Black-and-white film clips interspersed with CNR's monologue detracted from the stories rather than enhance them. But my biggest complaint, however, was the totally distracting soundtrack. Electric guitars and synthesizers played constantly, often making it difficult to hear CNR's words. The director attended the screening and explained that they were still editing the film, and he seemed to acknowledge that it was difficult to hear at times. I recommend more Charles, mellower editing, and far less soundtrack.

The good news is that the director announced the production team's desire to include as a DVD bonus feature an uncut film of CNR's stage show from 2003, which runs about three hours and has plenty of stories and anecdotes. Maybe my problems with the film are really to disguise my disappointment at never being able to see CNR's show live on stage. I hope that uncut film will provide the fix.",1H24M

In order to prove this, Dawkins visits sites and interviews people with either strong opposing views to debate with them, or people who he believes will strongly agree with him to prove his point that Religion and God is a complete delusion, and that people should really start questioning themselves, and become like he is, a man of Science. As an intellectual man, he does ask some important questions that encourage thinking, but I believe Dawkins is too harshly criticizing religions and is pushing his views on tense circumstances, forcing the cold hard truth on people who have already chosen their faith and belief and that he should just leave people to believe what they want. 

I personally found this movie hard to enjoy. While he an intellectual man, he can't seem to be able to accept the fact that not everyone believes in the same thing that he does. I believe that Religion is a very vulnerable and tense subject, therefore is very important not to push things too far. This is what I think Dawkins does by saying going to the Lourdes and after receiving statistics, concludes that all the 66 alleged miracles are meaningless and the conditions would have cleared up naturally. Next, he goes on to say that the ""fact"" that Mary's body ascended into heaven is an assumption, and that even the pop would have said it was revealed to him by God or that it was actually by word of mouth that this tradition came about and it is wrong. As he moves on to the issue of creationism and evolution. He says that we only have creationism because our world needed a supreme being such as a God to deal with the mystery surrounding us, but now that Science has explained that the Sun is one of billions of stars, he said it is time to abandon the belief of the God. As he debates with many other people, not only are his points not as strong as theirs, but he also doesn't let them freely speak. In fact, the movie even cuts of one man while he is speaking because he probably has a very strong point that Dawkins couldn't rebut. 

While Dawkins was definitely proud of his belief and knows it is true, this movie was hard to enjoy as he continued harshly forcing his beliefs on people who clearly did not agree with him.",1H30M

If you've read the 2 sentence blurb about the show (everyday objects, fantastics powers!) don't think you've got it. There are complexities underneath the surface of this show and it was very well done. The lead, Peter Krauss, used to be the lead on Six Feet Under. I expected higher profile roles for him after SFU died, and when I saw he signed on for Lost Room, I was disappointed. It sounded boring.

It isn't. Its a wild ride and I promise three things. You'll believe that Kevin Pollack can play menacing exceedingly well and Dennis Christopher isn't as cool as you remember him being back in Breaking Away about 100 years ago.

The last thing I can promise is that you will dig the show. Its supposedly coming on again in Jan 2007. If you haven't seen it, see it and tell your friends. This is one we want to get behind.

Scifi is starting to show up more and more often on my ReplayTV list. Being a huge science fiction fanboy geek, that's probably the way it always ought to have been but for years the channel was showing reruns of The Hulk and and old bad scifi TV. Lately, with BSG, Stargates (all flavors), hopefully soon for Painkiller Jane and Dresden Files, its finally coming into its own. I expect that in 2007, I may be watching it as much as I do HBO and Showtime and I pay for those!

But this documentary, written, directed, and produced by Charles Ferguson, an information technology expert and member of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Brookings Institution, shows in a rare non-ideological way, the mistakes made up to and during the Iraq invasion.

This is not an incendiary Michael Moore screed; it puts the left's argument in cool, rational light for the right to see clearly and attack as is its right. Ferguson grimly reminds us that information about the absence of WMD's was ignored to further an agenda that began immediately after 9/11 with the order to confirm a link between Al-Qaeda and Hussein's Ba'athist regime.

If you want more insanity, how about the order to disband the entire Iraqi army and Ba'ath party members from government service. That 2004 brought an insurgency of disaffected Sunni men who could have been serving in the necessary local army was no surprise. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's lack of preparation for post-invasion operations is just another depressing fact brought out by this sober, if not surprising or dramatically compelling documentary.

If you read the New York Times, you won't need the information in No End in Sight, but Ferguson puts it together so carefully and responsibly you might want to refer to it as you debate the neocons who claim the surge is working and the end is in sight.

A story of family, religion, hatred, oil and madness, focusing on a turn-of-the-century prospector in the early days of the business.",2008-01-25,"oil,misanthrope,loss of hearing,false prophet,alcoholic",8.2,hpoeng-805-524438,2013-09-30,"*NOTE: first time doing a movie review.*

Greed can lead to many things. Some good, some bad. It can often lead to a man's downfall. Set in the late 19th-century / early 20th- century, ""There Will Be Blood"" follows the story of Daniel Plainview. The story starts with the camera focused on a single man in a mine who is none other than Daniel. The movie opens up in silence. There is no dialogue, no speech. For 20 minutes I sat and observed a man in a hole mining for who knows what. In these first 20 minutes we are exposed to a number of things that set the tone for movie. We see a dry barren land, age old technology. You see a sweaty man working at a wall with his pickaxe in some dark and dusty hole. It's intense and dark. During these 20 minutes, Daniel strikes oil changing his life. Lives will be changed, decisions will be made, and there will be blood.

This movie appears to be filmed on location in Texas and in California, which is a great way to convey Paul Thomas Anderson's message. Half the things in the movie couldn't be done on set. Unless it was done by some type of magic, then kudos to the team. I personally think that filming on location adds another dimension of realism to the movie, especially since it is a western type movie. Back to what the message is. Well, if I were to take a swing at what the message is, I'm going to say it's about the struggle for power and control. You can take this away from Daniel and his enemy, Eli Sunday (who starts a church in Little Boston called ""The Third Revelation""). Both of them want it all, to be on top in their respective careers. However, the struggle and desire for power pits both Daniel and Eli together for control of Little Boston. It also provides a historical example for that time period. The message is conveyed fairly well in this movie. But that's not the only thing this movie has going on. I personally think the biggest aspect of this movie has to be the music. It's random, and gets you thinking. Mind you, there isn't any run in the park Benny Hill music. The music is dark, ominous and overall creepy. It sets up the scene and makes it interesting. A good example of this can be located within the first 20 minutes of the film. Creepy music starts to play when Daniel begins his descent back into the mine where the dynamite blew up. According to the creepy music, something bad was bound to happen and it did. The ladder Dan was using to climb down on broke, tossing him like a rag doll. Surprisingly enough, this is where he discovers oil. This makes me think that the music starts only when a significant moment is about to happen, which is it's own type of foreshadowing, for better for for worse.

As we progress through the story, you start to see the central theme of greed bloom at a rather rapid rate. Greed takes a grip on our main character Daniel and starts to drive the story in a different direction. He begins get a crazy but in a subtle way. Then, he just becomes a different man. It was amazing to the see the actor, Daniel Day-Lewis, take on this role and own it. He put so much energy and power into this roll and really convinced me that he was going crazy. I fully support Paul Thomas Anderson's cast choice. Each person totally owned his / her role, and made the movie as un-cheesy as possible. The shots were clear, and it wasn't gimmicky. We knew where all the important people were at all times during each scene. 

I would totally watch this movie again if I had the chance. It was plot driven, it never sidetracked, and each scene was significant to the development of the main character. Out of 10 i would give it a 9 simply because there is no such thing as perfect, only what we perceive to be perfect. It was intense, unpredictable, and overall enjoyable. I don't usually watch these kinds of movies, but this one just might get me hooked to the genre.",2H38M

Another crackling collaboration of Pixar and Disney, and as expected, it is touching, funny, thrilling and amazing to look at and watch. Only a step below Toy Story just because it is not quite as ground-breaking, though the story is even better.

While I love technology and effects, I am first and foremost a story guy when it comes to movies. This has as good of story as any film you will see. My only caution is that it seems geared towards grown-ups, not kids. The montage of Carl and Ellie growing old together is without dialogue and will probably bore some kids. Their parents certainly won't be bored; however, as it will resonate with most anyone over age 40 who hasn't taken the time to chase their childhood dreams.

No question, this film is a barrage of color and eccentric characters, and can even be a bit frightening at times. Still, the key to this one are the stories and quests of the elderly Mr. Fredrickson and the young Russell, trying to earn his badge of honor. From the beginning, Disney has always had a finger on the pulse of youngsters. Here, we aren't given the usual Hollywood garbage of brainiac kids who make the adults look stupid. Instead we are given a pudgy, slightly goofy kid just trying to get his parents to take note.

Special kudos to Ed Asner for bringing Mr. Fredrickson to life ... in good times and bad. He never goes overboard and is quite often absolutely perfect. Christopher Plummer has a limited role as bad guy Charles Muntz. Or is he really so bad? Cast aside by society, he has spent his life searching for redemption.

The plot involves storks and clouds. Apparently all babies (human and animal alike) are created in the clouds and each cloud has its own stork assigned to it. One stork is rather put upon, however, as his cloud seems a bit...crazy. Instead of creating cute babies, puppies and kittens like the other clouds, this one makes very, very dangerous babies that invariably hurt the poor stork. It's pretty funny seeing the stork get hurt again and again. It's also amazingly adorable seeing the little puppies and kittens--as it's animated in a very adorable style.

The casting of the two big sci-fi names made this no surprise but it was a little annoying still when I later read the good reviews it got. Credit to the BBC then for not only bringing a filmed version of the production to the television but also doing it in primetime on Boxing Day. I can't remember the last time the BBC did such a thing but it is certainly befitting their remit to do this and hopefully it will not be the last time.

To the film itself though. Three hours long as it is, the time does move well because the source material is as good as it is. Moments of drama, comedy, tragedy and intensity all blend well together, with lots going on in the main and on the edges – in summary the plot is simple but there are lots of nuances to be had here and, in this regard, it does help that the cast have done this material in full many times on stage. Focusing on the production as a production rather than a film, there is much to appreciate. Normally I'm not a fan of contemporary or modern settings for Shakespeare but here it doesn't get in the way – it doesn't add much to be sure but nor does it irritate or get in the way as I have seen it do in other productions. The reflective black stage is retained from the theatre version and it does provide a suitably stark backdrop to allow the viewer to focus on the actors. All of this relates to the production but the biggest difference here is that this is being made for television rather than a theatre and this is no small change.

Others have commented on the loss of the physical audience as a point in space for the cast but in fairness one would have thought that the focal point of the camera would have actually made this easier – particularly given the way that the stage in Stratford this was on is surrounded by the audience on three sides. However it doesn't work like that because stage director Doran (who directs here) doesn't seem to make a decision to either shoot it as a stage play or to embrace the use of the camera. This manifests itself in a sort of halfway house where at times it does one or the other well but mostly it resides in the middle where it isn't comfortable with either. Thus while we have moments where the camera compliments the action by virtue of its movement or where it is, mostly it just stays out of the way, apart from the CCTV gimmick (which fortunately is quickly dropped as an idea). As such it makes for an odd television film and I do think that more could have been done to make it more than just a filmed version of the stage production (which is what the makers said they were trying to avoid the film being).

The cast are mostly impressive. I have seen more impacting Hamlets but Tennant does do well and demonstrates a lot more range than he has the chance to do on Doctor Who. Is he a great Hamlet? I'd have to say no but he does engage and do a good job nonetheless. Stewart adds gravitas to his characters and he delivers a very good Claudius – not too slippery and treacherous but enough so we can see it in his heart. Downie is very good as Queen Gertrude while Davies, Gale, De Jersey and indeed most of the supporting cast are equally good. The only slight downside is that the habit of using the same actor for multiple very minor characters is a little more obvious on the screen than on the stage and it does distract at times.

Overall this version of Hamlet deserves credit for being produced for prime time on a terrestrial channel and it does have much about it to appeal to viewers. As a production of Hamlet it is enjoyable and very well put together but it does not replace seeing it on the stage, since it doesn't do a particularly good job of moving from stage to the screen.",3H

Dividing itself into five sections of a 'report', the film looks at the background and effect of the recession and its effect on politics, the world, society, the economy, public welfare, education, the present and the near and distant future.

Inside Job is undeniably motivational and does well to extract the hypocrisies and selfishness of the main perpetrators and other persons linked with the crisis. Indside Job depicts the global financial from only one perspective and does not give due weighting to the alternate point of view. Of course, it does not help that the main protagonists involved in the entire affair are obviously missing from this documentary, a fact that is rubbed on to the audience time and again.

On the flip side, economics, being a head scratcher for several budding commerce students by nature, the spoken narrative of figures and key personnel could perhaps have been better explained with a clearer use of graphics. However since the film makers are not lecturers it would be too much to expect them to be aware of the concepts of pedagogy.

Well crafted and edited, Inside Job is a good introduction to the cause and effect of the financial crisis, it falls just short of being the definitive version. It is a good watch nevertheless and provides sufficient food for thought and plenty of opportunity for future cocktail party discussion.",1H49M

You NEED to see this, but you might not like what you hear, which is ironically, exactly why you must see it.

I say this because 'The Weight of Chains' refuses to tow the line, oft laid-out by too many international media organisations and political bodies and disseminated to a generally ill-informed populus that is all too prepared to gobble-up what is served to them. Right off the bat, this means that many will immediately jump at the opportunity to label it as 'biased' and 'unbalanced', when in actual fact this could not be further from the truth.

The analysis of the internal and external political, social and economic factors that led to the break-up of Yugoslavia and the ongoing instability in the Balkans are well-explained within the film. It's a vivid depiction of the brutality of the conflicts that ravaged Yugoslavia in the 90s and continue today. As a viewer who resides in Australia and felt quite well-informed on the issue prior to watching the film, I was blown-away by it's quality and depth.

No conflict is black and white, there are always crimes on both sides in any war. The film neither denies that, nor celebrates it. The nature of war is that both sides fight and inevitably kill one another. Viewers will no doubt appreciate that 'The Weight of Chains' is not afraid to 'tell it as it is' and in doing so, challenge it's viewers' own biases and prejudices. It uses this as a platform to look at why events took place and what could have been done to prevent them, rather than simply who was to blame for them.

The film's wide-ranging and heavy use of evidence, research, first-hand accounts and interviews really defies any claims of propaganda or bias. Look at it as a cold case file that has been re-opened after several years - in light of new evidence and information, the account of what took place is clearer but also quite different to what was purported earlier. That's often tough for audiences and people in general to accept. In this sense, the film's approach outlines quite reasonably that Serbs have been unjustifiably demonised and that there is reason to question and investigate NATO, UN, US and EU actions not only in the former Yugoslavia, but all over the world. Surely most would agree, not unreasonable claims at all, especially when they're backed-up as well as they are.

Overall, this is a stellar look at a very complex issue by a film and director that seek to inform, rather than influence. Sadly, too few people are willing to let the truth get in the way of a good story. Fortunately, 'The Weight of Chains' provides both.",2H5M

And now, it is unlikely he ever will. O'Neal died on November 29, 2011 from complications from a stroke he suffered in mid-October due to his diabetes. For his entire life he struggled with weight-management and diabetes. Elephant in the Room was his first, and only, comedy special he ever made.

What made Patrice O'Neal so unique was his spontaneous delivery. He referred to his specials as ""conversational,"" and not of a typical breed. You can tell from Elephant in the Room that, while some skits were written, many jokes stemmed from the audience and audience participation. Patrice encourages fans to shout out answers to his questions so he can form a punchline in an impromptu manner. I think this is what a lot of people either didn't pay attention to, or didn't realize this and that's why he never reached a respectable height in his career.

If it hadn't been for his final Television appearance on The Comedy Central Roast of Charlie Sheen, I doubt many people would even know who he was. Same with Greg Giraldo. How many people would've known him if Comedy Central didn't make his name what is was? It's a question that will never be answered, just pondered.

Elephant in the Room is just what it sounds like. Patrice is referring to big issues like animal cruelty, racism, cheating, harassment, and many other issues, he feels, he needs to address. He tackles them in a way where humor comes natural, as it derives from the situation himself. Take for example when he discusses animal cruelty, a topic I really hate to bring up. It's a heartless and cruel form of abuse, like any type. Patrice doesn't poke fun at the idea, but the gratuitous, guilt-bringing commercials. Now that's funny.

Of course, there are times when the special doesn't go in the proper direction. In the very beginning, Patrice gets to hung up on the topic of ""breasts"" and the idea feels tired and dreary. I would've much rather seen Patrice use those minutes to provide more of his insanely spontaneous remarks and philosophy on unsung issues. He brings such valid points to the table, especially when talking about the over-exaggerated issue of harassment.

The special refrains from useless skit, which is one of the highest compliments I can give a comedy special. I hate skits. They're drab and unnecessary. Especially when it stars a comedian in costume when he/she should be on stage with a mic in their hands. Patrice devotes seventy-seven minutes to just him, the mic, and the audience. Patrice also refrains from excessive uses of the n word, a word used far too much with current black comedians. I can't recall Patrice using the word more than five or six times. Maybe he spoke so softly and fluently that it was muted, but I highly doubt it.

Sadly, Patrice's career ended far too early. His death was not only saddening because he was so young, but because we all know a seventy-seven minute special obviously can't contain the weight, no pun intended, of his philosophy and wit. I think he would've been one of the many comedians who got better with age and wisdom. He almost reminds me of the later George Carlin, circa 2004 - 2007. Carlin become more philosophical in his later years rather than his very blunt, vulgar character he created in the seventies. If Patrice could form a side of maturity pretty well at the beginning of his career, imagine how greatly it could've improved with many more years of experience.

I think you can get most of how I feel about the movie from that sentence alone. It is a documentary where everything is on cruise control, the narrator guides you from event to event, people are interviewed and sometimes they cry, there are scenic helicopter shots repeated ad nauseam, and some Native Americans show up to say something vaguely spiritual. This really wouldn't be worth much if the subject matter, an orca named ""Luna"" trying to make some friends, wasn't so strong. As such, it ends up being more than the sum of its parts.

This documentary is the story of an orca that got separated from its family. Very early on we learn from a less zany Ryan Reynolds (as the narrator) that orcas stay with their families for their entire life. Alone, and without social contact, Luna stumbles upon, and makes a home of, a place called Nootka Sound. In this stretch of sea it befriends the locals and draws some controversy, as many have differing opinions on what should be done about this whale. The main tension of the documentary comes from the idea that the orca should be left alone, despite its want for attention. Those who hold this view the orca as a liability or safety concern, and state that it is even detrimental to interfere with this whale's life. The other side of this is that Luna is just trying to make a connection, and it is cruel to deny him that.

The documentary does a good job at exploring this bizarre relationship that a community has with this orca. It is touching and sad to see how much it desires attention. The orca will come up to side of boats, and seems to revel in the experience of being gawked at and touched. A lot of the documentary is moving because Luna himself is so surreal, and the interactions between him and everyone is playful and practically human. There is something innately understandable to us concerning the want for companionship. Luna just wants to be friends, and it is heartbreaking because he really does not understand the controversy that goes on around him. You get wrapped in the story so much because of this. This is by far the best aspect of the movie, and it is worth watching because of it.

Unfortunately, the documentary itself has a made for TV feel to it. Ryan Reynolds does an OK job as the narrator, but sometimes his lines feel corny and lack substance. Actually, a much better fit for narrator would be Michael Parfit, who is he director of the movie and was also a journalist who wrote about Luna. In his brief speaking moments he would often say things that are more profound and thought provoking than anything Reynolds said in the entire movie. 

Further, while there is tension in the film concerning the real safety concerns that an orca in habituated waters draws, the documentary remains oddly neutral despite an obvious skew. I wish it made a stand, or an accusation, or anything. There was clearly something wrong with how this was handled by the government, but it is only hinted at through slight frustration. I did not want an attack or a diatribe, but it failed to analyze what went wrong and how it could have been better.

Lastly, I am tired of watching a documentary where the narrator will say something vaguely scientific and random pieces of journal or newspaper articles will fly toward the screen, sometimes with highlighted words. It is a stupid effect, and it highlights the fact that this movie is only a little scientific and spends too much time on building Luna up as some sort of mysterious entity, almost mystical. The analogy between Luna and an extraterrestrial is made one too many times. We get it, it's a stranger in a strange land kind of story. So, let it speak for itself and stop beating me over the head with it.

To sum it up, ""The Whale"" is worth watching because the story itself is provoking and rightfully pulls at all of those humanoid emotional strings. It ends up transcending a documentary that, by itself, is rather poorly produced.",1H25M

Together, both provide a rather detailed account not only of Prohibition's place in American history, but the events leading up to such, the results of repeal and the long-lasting societal impact of the entire matter. Separate, both are still strong, informative and entertaining yet each tend to focus on different themes that sometimes do not intermingle and the result is noticeable.

Ken Burns, in his trademarked fashion, intermingles fantastically- original photos and video with colorful interviews from subject-matter experts and first-hand histories over-laced with celebrity voice-overs, makes learning hip and brings about a passion for a dark, but necessary, time in American history. Burns' documentary was too light in certain instances where a deeper look at American history would have benefited the story. Okrent's novel definitely fills in such details that Burns either ignored or edited out but was definitely too heavy at times with whole sections coming across as a historical text book rather than an entertaining narrative.

Burns, and Okrent as well, enlighten 21st-Century audiences to the fact that Prohibition, what can be now considered a silly arrangement, was not only responsible for the rise of Jazz, the introduction of mixed drinks and the invention of speed boats but also led to very beginnings of the Civil Rights Movement and the outright success of Women's Suffrage. 

Naturally, Burns provides much attention to that of the gangsters of the era, particularly Chicago's Al Capone. But again, he provides just enough details for a satisfactory display of information yet fails to get deeper. Similarly, this occurs when discussing the role of the Church and the Prohibition movement. Dry Congressmen and Senators knew how to convince their Baptist and Methodist ministers to use the pulpit to condemn the evils of alcohol, particularly in the Mid-West states. 

Likewise, Prohibition was an outcry not just against alcohol but also against the rise of poor immigrants filling America's urban centers. The Irish, the Germans, the Italians, all known for enjoying wine and spirits, and all Catholics, became a scary threat for ""decent, Protestant country folks"". Cutting off immigrants from their alcohol was a way to ensure that these new Americans were productive members of society, not a burden of filthy drunkards. Burns did not spend too much time on these ideals. 

However, Burns attention to detail and crafting of a narrative tale is shown in his vision and with what is presented. He does keep entertainment at the forefront of his documentary, much like what he has done in the past, especially with his must-see Baseball series. Some indirect humor is presented with history playing the comedian to a more naïve time. Burns does get political with some of his views, but at no time are such views sobering enough to prevent the viewer from seeking out a drink.",

A central theme is what happens when commercialization and politics lay their mostly self serving hands on a religious event. The story opens with the alleged manifestation of a God figure, experienced by a young villager while lying asleep under a tree. He ignores friendly advice to keep it for himself, and a journalist becomes aware of the event. After that it all gets out of control. A temple is built, notwithstanding several wise men insisting that there are better ways to spend the building costs. More and more tourists visit the place. A holy city grows in the middle of the desert, totally overwhelming the once peaceful village.

We observe all this happening as a stepwise process. Clearly, most people take advantage of the growing prosperity, and prefer to ignore the negative side effects. They even conveniently forget that is was God who it was all about. All characters appearing in this film seem true to themselves, and behave natural in their assumed roles. Authenticity as it should be.

Ingenious script, and it works well for the whole 135 minutes running time. The film was never boring, in spite of its relatively slow pace. The latter blends in with the environment, as we see the villagers never do very much, and they seem to enjoy their uncomplicated lives. Also adding to my positive experience was that we hear wonderful music from time to time, that makes very good listening even to our European ears. And last but not least I admired the nice landscapes we get to see.

I don't think it is useful to summarize all characters and their relationships here. You see them appear at appropriate moments, without overwhelming the viewer, regardless of their vast number. The core theme is very obvious: the commercialization of religion in combination with how an insignificant event gets hijacked by politicians. Everyone seems to grow and prosper as a result, so who cares?

Finally, I'm not sure I understood the (hidden?) meaning of the final scene. We see a looter, visibly wounded, approach from a distance. In my opinion it suggests a 2nd coming. Maybe someone to clean out the whole godless mess that the village had become. But I'm speculating now.",2H15M

This is the simple idea here and it is laid out to be a very convincing children's television show as the notebook sings about imagination and creativity in a very generic way. This song is catchy but also has some really great lines and moments – ""green is not a creative color"" being my favorite because it made me laugh and also reminds us that generally trying to ""teach"" creativity will just need to reinforce bounds rather than encourage freedom.

The notebook gets what it wants as the three characters start to explore whatever comes to their imaginations, leading to some disturbing images and situations which very quickly take the cheerful little short out of the world of kids TV and into the dark world that lies inside. It is very cleverly done because it is funny, spot on as a satire and really well made. I see that the film has 12 million views on YouTube and, although I had never heard of it, I am not surprised that it struck a chord.",
Paan Singh Tomar,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTgwODM5OTMzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA3NzI1Nw@@._V1_.jpg,"Action,Biography,Crime,Sport,Thriller","Irrfan Khan,Mahie Gill,Rajesh Abhay,Hemendra Dandotiya",Tigmanshu Dhulia,"Paan Singh Tomar is a movie starring Irrfan Khan, Mahie Gill, and Rajesh Abhay. The story of Paan Singh Tomar, an Indian athlete and seven-time national steeplechase champion who becomes one of the most feared dacoits in Chambal...",2012-03-02,"athlete,army,steeplechase,journalist,police",8.2,uttiyo-sarkar56,2012-03-13,"Boosted By An Excellent Performance by Irfan Khan and the rest of the cast, and a meaningful and good story, Pan Singh Tomar is one of the better bollywood movies which has great performances from the cast, a great story which is worth telling, and Irfan Khan just makes it better with his excellent portrayel of his character.

The Story is about a Daku(Dacoit)(Irfan) who was actually a soldier who fought for his country and could give it all for his country who then became a runner and wins gold medal at the Indian national games, but is forced to become a Dacoit after being neglected and insulted by the Police,and his mission is to rebel and defy the police department.

Irfan Khan is one of the few Hollywood worthy actors in bollywood, and probably the best at what he does, he yet again shows his excellent acting qualities in this movie by giving an excellent performance as Paan Singh Tomar, and he has shown the change of his character from a strict soldier to a notorious dacoit with utmost skill. The Rest of the cast also does a very good job in making this into a very well acted movie.

The Director does a decent job in making this film into one of the sensible movies made in bollywood, and good job from him for giving Irfan a perfect role in the movie. The Story which is based on a true story about the same man, is great and shows how many extremely talented athletes in India are neglected by the government and how they can become notorious at times. 

Overall this movie is great due to mainly an excellent performance by Irfan Khan and a great story, to make this into one of the better movies of 2012 till now.

Shala is not about kids going to school nor is it a children's film, even remotely. All that it has in common with Stanley ka Dabba begins and ends at the animated sequence that plays with the opening credits. Shala takes you to the next level: while you are still at school and your friends are important, you step onto the threshold of the adult world and start making sense of it.

Most actors in the film have delivered a restrained performance. Anshuman Joshi emotes wonderfully as the protagonist Mukund Joshi. Ketaki Mategonkar who plays Shirodkar does a contrived act initially but entices with her charm in no time. Joshi and the other boys, particularly Mhatre (Ketan Pawar) are required to dabble in a range of emotions as they come-of-age: love, fear, rage and rejection. They do it naturally and convincingly.

Do not give Shala a miss. It is a self-assured and grounded debut by a filmmaker which offers a lesson or two in simple storytelling straight from the heart, complete with soulful music. It is one of those gems that Marathi cinema throws up once in a while; totally localized in flavor yet universal in appeal.",1H48M

But the essence of it is demanding and commendable. Everyone has done a splendid job. This one is not loose even for a minute. The most important aspect of its appreciation is its star-cast. A lot of new faces and still it doesn't disappoint. You can just imagine the crew on board when actors like Piyush Mishra & Yashpal Sharma are totally wasted. An entertaining cinema worth watching. There is no doubt that Anurag Kashyap is Bollywood's Quentin Tarantino. A must watch.",5H21M
