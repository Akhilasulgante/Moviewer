The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off.

Duck Amuck,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZhNGExOTktNDgzOC00OWJjLWE2NjMtYTNmZmQ3MWM0MzA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc2NTQzMjU@._V1_.jpg,"Animation,Short,Comedy,Family,Fantasy",Mel Blanc,Chuck Jones,"Duck Amuck is a short starring Mel Blanc. The short-tempered Daffy Duck must improvise madly as the backgrounds, his costumes, the soundtrack, even his physical form, shifts and changes at the whim of the animator.",1953-02-28,"cartoon character draws own reality,reference to longfellow,animation filmmaking,unhappy actor,pencil",8.6,Quinoa1984,2004-02-01,"One of Chuck Jones' most beautifully crafted short cartoon pieces, Duck Amuck is one of the first (or the first?) cartoons to work the element of the theatre into an animated short. As Woody Allen did in Annie Hall (though that was twenty-four years later), the filmmakers here create that acknowledgment of there being an audience- and, more amusingly, their acknowledgment of themselves being apart of the process. I'm certain there were other animated shorts from Looney Tunes where a character may have one or twice looked at the 'audience' and asked a question or said a joke, but I'm also certain it wasn't done to such a length as this. Quite possibly, this is one of the greatest one-joke/in-joke stretches ever put on film.

At the start, Daffy Duck thinks he's about to be in a piece as a musketeer- that is, until the background is pulled right out from under him. He'll never get back to that background again, but Daffy will keep on trying to persuade the animator to bring back some sense into the works. By the end he's exasperated, and the joke comes full circle to be totally satisfying.

Throughout the short what keeps it so funny on repeat viewings is that the absurdities of each new backdrop and each run-in Daffy keep their validity. There's a lot of creative juice flowing through this one, and since the turns are unexpected on the first viewing, on the following ones you laugh at yourself for laughing at it again. Another plus is that Daffy Duck is a superb character when he's kept on his toes- like when he's put against a city backdrop that looks like it was drawn by a five-year old. He asks, ""Now, how about some color, stupid!"" And then is painted over in bizarre hues. The joke that follows that is one of Chuck Jones' most surreal executions. 

Overall, a classic for its time, influential; on a level that will perhaps get the adults laughing more so than the kids, and for those in youth who discover it for the first time on TV or on the new DVD, it isn't old- this is the kind of sense of humor found on other modern cartoons (Simpsons, for example).",7M

The story has become quite influential to filmmakers from the likes of John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) to John Lasseter (A Bug's Life): a small village has been terrorized by bandits for far too long, amid times of civil war in the nation, and so on the advice of Grand-Dad, they decide to hire four - which soon becomes seven - samurai for the job. There's no money, just food and honor, even though the village isn't exactly pleased to have samurai back in their village. Each character is drawn and executed compellingly, though for my money Toshiro Mifune proves why he became one of Japan's most notorious film actors. His work as the brave, bold outcast of the seven is awe-inspiring practically all the way through, like the hero of a western that anyone can root for since he's a true rebel at heart within a group of men with a task at hand. 

Kurosawa directs his tale and main and supporting players like a grand composer, orchestrating a vivid story and extracting from great actors like Takashi Shimura (the old, wise Samurai), Ko Kimura (the disciple Samurai), Daisuke Kato (Schichiroji), and Mifune (Kikuchiyo, which isn't his real name) just the right touches of humanity, humor, tragedy, romance, and intensity. The overall intensity, by the way, isn't over-estimated; its long length (almost 3 1/2 hours) isn't distracting in the slightest since Kurosawa's editing and photography (the later helmed by Asakazu Nakai) are extraordinary. Not to compare the two films, but one thing I saw in common with Seven Samurai and a Lord of the Rings film is that, if anything else, it definitely isn't a boring experience. Along with a score by Fumio Hayasaka that gives the film just a bit more of a pulse, and a showdown that is relentless with excitement, this is one of the must-see action films for film buffs, or anyone with an serious interest in having fun with an epic.",3H27M

Those few characters' state of mind and their relationship dynamics at that point in time, was conveyed with such explosive intensity, I got gut punched drunk.

 Pather Panchali boasts of suitably melodramatic yet highly intuitive performances. Its breath taking cinematography ranks alongside existential beauty this side of Malick heaven. The musical scoring, by the great Ravi Shankar, is identifiably Indian, yet universally sublime. Together, these myriad parts melded into a whole so grand in its social consciousness, so incisively intimate in its portrait of one family, I could do nothing but be slowly devoured like a most willing prey. 

On 4th Oct 2003, I saw my all time favourite film, Tokyo Story. The feeling I got today from Pather Panchali, is as close as is possible from that fateful October day.

But among them there are just a few that go beyond great. They belong to the league of their own"". Masaki Kobayashi's ""Harakiri"" aka ""Seppuku"" is one of them. The film of rare power and humanism, of highest artistic achievements, profoundly moving, tragic like the best Shakespeare's plays, universal and timeless even if it takes place in the faraway country of 1630, by the words of one of the reviewers ""Harakiri"" ""is to cinema as the Sistine Chapel is to painting. Unsurpassable!"" 

The film grabbed me from the very first shot, from its opening credits with their perfect harmony of kanji (I believe it is a correct word to describe the writings) characters, with the unusual disturbing score and with the dark beauty of the images. And then the story begins that centers on Hanshiro Tsugumo (Tatsuya Nakadai), one of hundreds or maybe even thousands unemployed lord less samurais, ronin, that in the blessed times of peace had not many choices to adjust to new life and often preferred to commit a ritual suicide, hara-kiri or seppuku on the property of the wealthy estate owners. According to Bushido, the way of the samurai, ""One who is a samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night . . . the fact that he has to die. That is his chief business."" 

At the same time, samurai and anti-samurai film, ""Harakiri"" offers the masterfully screened scenes of sword-fights, not plentiful but exquisitely choreographed, perfectly paced and unbearably intense but the film is much more than that. It is also a gripping court drama where the truth is unfolded in the flashbacks. The viewers are allowed to look closer at the noble Samurai code of behavior and to reflect on how its abuse impacts the fate of an individual and the society in general. Compelling, poetic, and tragic, the movie has one of the most pessimistic endings ever that makes you wonder how the history is made, how the historical events are interpreted and who decides what would be written in the chronicles and important documents and what would be left out.

A Masterpiece, one of the best movies ever made, ""Harakiri"" deserves all its praise. It is not in my nature to force my opinion on anyone but if you call yourself a movie buff or a movie lover, you MUST see this film.",2H13M

I read somewhere that the director took Charlie Chaplin as a model for his comedy, and the influence shows here, even to the point of the short-subject-length segments -- and especially in the first story. That one is basically a pure slapstick comedy, drawing gags from the situation of the Sharik character (who actually ends up resembling Harold Lloyd in appearance and behavior more than Chaplin) working part time on a construction site, alongside the man who he caused to be working there as a sentence. 

The second segment is the one I thought to be the greatest success, as it combines the visual humor (many sequences of which, throughout, would work without dialogue at all) with a well-tuned funny situation and good actor chemistry. The third and titular segment is amusing as well, but perhaps get a little too involved in its own story.

In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner.  Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat' Western.

The three main characters make the film.  Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil personified.  Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants.  Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing.  (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.)  Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film.  All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.

The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film.  Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on.  The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable.  Any typical Western cliché that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling.  Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect.  Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. 

This movie is absolutely brilliant.  If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so.  Immediately.  (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

The praise is well-deserved.

During a meteor storm, McCoy accidentally injects himself with an overdose of cordrazine, which leads him to paranoid insanity. He beams himself down to the planet being orbited by the Enterprise, escapes through a time portal, resulting in the obliteration of the Enterprise's world. Kirk and Spock go back through the portal to try and intercept McCoy (who has interfered with the past), and land in the New York City of the 1930s. They are taken in by Edith Keeler (Joan Collins), a pacifistic social worker, and Kirk begins to fall in love.

As the summary indicates, this episode is the perfect confluence of superb science fiction writing (Harlan Ellison), well-honed directing (Joseph Pevney), and sensitive acting (Shatner and Nimoy in particular). The script is incredibly well-written by one of the best science fiction writers of all time, and uses modest humor (e.g., Spock's clueless insistence on securing platinum, Kirk's explanation of Spock's ears to a policeman, etc.) to keep the story from becoming overly maudlin. For those who believe that William Shatner could not act (i.e., those who had never seen him in his early TV days), his nuanced and sympathetic performance clearly shows how good of an actor he could be. Likewise, Joan Collins acquits herself quite well, and Nimoy is, as always, marvelous. Spock's final line in the 1930s world alone is worth the viewing.",

His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.",2H55M

Those names would be John Cleese and Ricky Gervais. While Gervais recently found comedy through his program called 'The Office', Cleese has been providing wit, wisdom, and down-right hysteria for the past several decades. While away from his namesake (Monty Python), you can find Cleese comfortable in several other roles that showcase his bubbling talent. One of those programs just happens to be the funniest bit of crumpet called 'Fawlty Towers'. 

Remembering this show when I was a child and was on our local PBS station, I eagerly bought it when it was released on DVD about a year ago. Since then, I have watched random episodes here and there but never fully taking in the enjoyment from watching it all. So, today I decided to sit down and watch this series from beginning to end and I have yet to finish laughing. If this program doesn't define comic genius, I don't know what does. Never have I witnessed a show that has continually been fresh, hysterical (I cannot use that word enough), real, and outlandish all at the same time. Normally, with our current television programming, you need to pick or choose which it will be, but thankfully 'Fawlty Towers' is all of these and many more. 

Cleese remains in top form as Basil Fawlty, the owner/manager of the B&B that just happens to have his hands and over-worked imagination in everything. With the aid of his helpers Manuel (he's from Barcelona) and Polly (co-writer Connie Booth and ex-wife of Cleese), Cleese always seems to find himself in a heap of trouble with his wife Sybil (the dragon of the hotel). Armed with physical humor and a snake-like banter, we witness everything from a dead body, hotel inspectors, a failed anniversary party, a moose head, and a Himalayan rodent of sorts happen to this simple, everyday, B&B. This is not only a few of the episodes you will find in the complete set, but also the daily stress that Basil finds himself falling into daily.

This series, again, is hysterical. Cleese is the master of his trade while proving that he can manage any task thrown in front of him. While some will argue that he overshadows the rest of the cast, I would say 'hogwash' to that. My two favorite characters in this series were Major and Manuel. The comedy that they provide cannot be found on television today. All I need to say is thank God for the BBC.

Just think about Larry Flynt in ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" or Andy Kaufman in ""Man on the Moon"", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.

The movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn't mean that the movie isn't filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a 'wonderful' ending which I'm not going to spoil.

Yes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie. It was a really Oscar worthy performances, which he also received. Another Oscar winner for her performance was Louise Fletcher, which in my opinion is a bit too much credit. She plays her role well but nothing more than that. She did not deeply impressed me or anything. This movie also marks the debut for some today well known actors such as Danny DeVito (he looked so young and different!), Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif, who also received an Oscar nomination.

Really one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life.

The movie keeps us remembering the whole funny situations that we were in, during those years; various ways of cheating exams, running out of class with kinds of funny excuses just to go and watch the final matches, smoking in the toilets during the break-time and so on... Of course the movie gives great lessons against these behaivors with the help of one character which lead the whole ""Hababam Sinifi"" series. Mahmut Hodja. His moral values and commitment to his students had us all get wet eyes during this comedy. But of course not only him, the whole cast had his own different character profiles. Body Ekrem (which was played by ""The Extraoridnary"" Sener Sen), Inek Saban, Guduk Necmi, Hafize Ana etc. But of course non of these characters could come to life without the great observations of the fabulous director, Ertem Egilmez (may he rest in peace).

The great strengths of I, CLAUDIUS are in the driving pace, sharp wit, and ferocity of Jack Pulman's script and the host of brilliant performers who play it out. Chief among these are Sian Phillips as the calculating, murderous, and unspeakably cold Livia, wife of Augustus; although Derek Jacobi gives a justly famous performance in the title role, it is Phillips who dominates and drives the story with this, the most brilliant performance of her career. But this is not to disparage the overall cast, which is remarkably fine and includes such noted artists as Brian Blessed, John Hurt, Patricia Quinn, Patrick Stewart, and a host of others.

Like the serpent that appears in the open credits, the story twists and winds--and covers several generations of the ruling family as Rome slips from the republic to royal rule, largely due to the manipulations of Livia, who has few if any scruples in her determination to rule first through her husband and then through her son. Although the look of the film is somewhat dated, it in no way impairs the power of the piece, and I, CLAUDIUS remains one of the handful of miniseries that actually improves upon repeated viewings. Strongly, strongly recommended.

The question, essentially, is whether it would be better to live as a slave and endure severe abuse but have a clear conscience or to live as an abusive slave owner and have no conscience at all. Although they each reach various conclusions their beliefs and values are soon put to the test with surprising results. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a deep but rather dark film made even more interesting by the historical context involving the Russian offensive into Hungary.

In fact, the comedy's from the 70's made a major impact in the following Turkish comedy history.

Shortly the movie is about a class of slackers, all boys who don't study and are constantly trying to do all kinds of pranks or trying to escape out of the dormitory etc. In this Hababam the whole class actually fails the exams, and the school is threatened to be closed.

Compared to western standards this movie can be seen as a normal family comedy, but the thing what makes it really good is the individual contribution/improvisation of the various actors (whom became one of the greatest of the Turkish comedy history). There is given some decent amount of freedom to the actors to give their own flavor to it. And I think the actors did an excellent job doing this, especially Kemal Sunal and Sener Sen, because of this there are a lot of small very funny scenes throughout the whole movie, which made the movie very enjoyable, rich and therefore re-watchable. 

This movie in particular has something special to it, not only because most people watched this movie over and over since their childhood, but also because of the jokes and it also gets a bit more serious in the end.

Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.

There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.

It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.

This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.

Along come two robots, ""Droids"" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.

The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.

With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you.",2H1M

Anyone who knew about the private life of Kemal Sunal would know that in his personal life he was a very serious man. His on screen persona's (unfortunately for a lifelong fan such as myself, who had hoped otherwise) were nothing like his own personality. He continues in the role of 'Saban', the surreal, chaotically stupid on screen persona he adopted in many films. His role in this film I wouldn't regard as exaggerated at all, as a matter of opinion, it seems far more toned down in comparison to his performances in, say, the Hababam Sinifi series. I think if anything, Halit Akçatepe's performance as Ramazan spoiled the overall quality of the film, as he forgot he was merely a supporting role and instead tried to outshine Sunal with no real success. As for Sener Sen, he plays the same sturdy supporting role which he does in many films which he played alongside Kemal Sunal, this performance being exemplary. The real great performance aside from Sunal's is without doubt Sevket Altug's minor role as Yunus Kaptan. Its unfortunate that his later works didn't quite meet up to the promise he showed in this film with his madcap naval officer. Special mention also goes to Sevda Aktolga, who understated her role in this film even though she was the object of Saban and Ramazan's affections (though, to be honest, because shes so attractive I used to wish there was more of her in it!). Ultimately, although some people might find influence from other films of the time emulated in this film, to suggest that The Return of Pink Panther was ripped off is absurd, as it really doesn't fit in with the structure of Turkish humour, Overall, Turkish humour is abundant in this film, and an array of original material, highlighted by Kemal Sunal and Sevket Altug, is on show for all to see.",1H30M

 For the ones who are non-Turkish, it may seem like a stupid serie but you should watch it in original sound, undertitled so you can get the amusing dialogs and facial expressions better. Especially, Saban character should be watched with his original voice to get entertained.

Lastly, this series is shot in late 70s and all episodes are really nice and will be watched again and again.

This television broadcast made for BBCs Granada Television immortalizes their West End and Broadway success of Harold Pinter's fascinating though impenetrable play about the late night meeting between Hirst, a wealthy man of letters and Spooner, a down-at-heels Bohemian poet, which may represent the finest non-Shakespearean performances of either actors' careers. Particularly memorable is Gielgud, who presents Spooner as a clinging, fawning W. H. Auden-like poser which may be his most effective attempt at portraying a characterization on film outside of the typical stiff and very British Gielgud personae that we've grown accustomed to seeing in films like ""Arthur"" and ""The Elephant Man"".

Richardson is also marvelous as the more mysterious Spooner, who sometimes recalls Harry Meyers in ""City Lights"" as a millionaire who invites a tramp into his privileged world when he's plastered only to forget him when he sobers up, as well as Michael Kitchen and Terence Rigby offering excellent support as Hirst's flunkies. But it is Gielgud's masterful work as a sleazy pretender that creates the greatest impression.

Pinter's fascinating though somewhat baffling play has received some major revivals since its original production, most memorably with Christopher Plummer as Spooner and Jason Robards as Hirst (making his final stage performance) in a 1994 Broadway production and a 1992 London staging starring Pinter himself in the role of Hirst, but the play will forever be identified with Richardson and Gielgud in their final appearance together.

Many of the characters, motives and stories are based on reality. The main story line - the concept trial of minister Daniel and his group is about the concept trial of communist leader and minister Rajk. He was an ideologist communist and they said that he could be the next leader of Hungary after Rakosi who was the Stalinist leader of Hungary between 1949 and 1956. Rajk had different ideas than Rakosi on many questions. He got apprehended in 1949. He had a public trial where everything was pre-arranged. The false accusation and the testimonies of the witnesses were written by Rákosi's administration and Moscow. The witnesses were prepared and trained by the ÁVH (Hungarian KGB). Many intellectuals actually did believe in communism but after the Rajk trial and the mystic disappearance of people on a mass scale showed everyone the true face of the Rákosi regime. It was very uncertain whether Bacsó can make the film at all. The party made some suggestions. For example the original script referred to the traitor Daniel as the ""Daniel gang"" like Rajk and his friends were called the ""Rajk gang"". The censors asked Bacsó to alter the term ""gang"" to ""group"" as the term gang was a too clear reference to Rajk.

The characters: - There was a major party member and army general who was the model of comrade Bástya. - Comrade Virág was based on the much feared ÁVH leader Péter Gábor. ÁVH did took a lot of people from their homes in the middle of the night in black, curtained cars. They tried to convince and break people by being both brutal and nice. Comrade Virág uses all kind of methods to drive Pelikán to be the key witness. Also the clothes of the ÁVH agents are very much like the real and Virág's room has many references how some party leaders were thinking and living.

Pelikán's jobs: - Swimming pool: There was a major party member who used to get one of Budapest's major swimming pools emptied when he wanted to swim. This comrade kept this habit even in the seventies. - Theme park: The original name of the Hungarian theme park was really English Park that has changed sometime in the Rákosi regime. Also the scenic railway really had a communist version where they showed how the society evolved (according to Engels' theory). - Hungarian orange: It is true that Hungarians wanted to grow orange in Hungary. The project was launched by Rákosi himself.

There are also a lot of references in the movie to real persons and events most of which can be understood by the ones actually lived in Hungary in the 50's. Bacsó said that the last scene where comrade Virág and Pelikán met on the tram and the tram door closed very much resembled the days when the film was made. Although the Stalinist Rákosi regime was over the and the prisoners of the 50's and their guards were still there. They traveled on the closed tram together like fishes in an aquarium.",1H45M

A screen version of the works of the famous English writer Arthur Conan Doyle about the world's most famous detective Sherlock Holmes and his adventures with the notorious assistant Dr. Watson. Well, finally, I got my hands on this episode, shot by the talented Soviet director Igor Maslennikov. I love the whole series immensely and I revise it from time to time for the umpteenth time, and here's my short opinion - The Best Sherlock Holmes. I do not intend to talk about the minuses, because there are none, and if you really want to nitpick about the little things, then read the review of someone else. Yes, this is a very subjective review, but I will still describe the expressive merits that make this picture a real masterpiece of Soviet cinema. So, here they are: 1. Atmosphere - from the first shots, the creators immerse the viewer in Victorian England, or rather London, with its well-known attributes, stiffness, costumes, and norms of behavior. Environment, small details, scenery, nature. Yes, London was played by the Soviet Riga and Leningrad, but the audience doesn't care. The atmosphere is excellent in all parts. The creators clearly tried - and they have earned my praise and the love of the audience for more than one generation! 2. Music - the composer Vladimir Dashkevich has created amazingly high quality and so attractive music that it is known even outside the former Soviet Union. It's not worth mentioning the title topic, how many alterations I have heard, but nobody has succeeded in surpassing the original and will never succeed! 3. Humor - surprisingly, in such a serious detective story there was a place for humor. But there is no need to worry, it is easy to understand, but you should not wait for ""wild rzhaki"", rather humor here serves to defuse. 4. Detective stories - in the first episode (Acquaintance) our heroes are just getting to know each other and decide to solve one riddle, and in the second (Bloody Inscription) our homies have to unravel a rather curious and non-trivial case from the philistine point of view. Its finale will make you think about some things and seal the unbreakable friendship of a retired doctor and an eccentric London detective. Of course, when you are not watching a detective story for the first time, you lose interest, but you still enjoy the process itself, and when all this is played by very talented actors, it is doubly pleasure! 5. Excellent cast - the director has collected, I'm not afraid of this word, the entire color of Soviet cinema in this series, here are just a few names (in addition to the main characters): Igor Dmitriev, Borislav Brundukov, Nikolai Karachentsov and others. When so many talents gather under one roof, success is guaranteed! Well, the gatherings of Holmes and Watson at the end of each episode are priceless! Well, everyone knows about replacing the word ""Afghanistan"" with ""East"" in the first episode. You yourself know that it was in that year that we entered Afghanistan, and what this led to is known. Censorship, so I had to re-sound, nothing can be done. A little about the main characters: 1. Sherlock Holmes performed by Vasily Borisovich Livanov is an eccentric London detective who is able to solve any crime. Loves intricate puzzles. A monstrous snob with an unimaginable number of bad habits, but after meeting Dr. Watson, he becomes the last sincere and devoted friend. The best role of Vasily Borisovich in his entire long career and simply the best screen embodiment of the legendary detective! Sincere bravo Vasily Borisovich and good health to you! 2. Dr. Watson performed by Vitaly Methodievich Solomin is a retired military doctor who arrived after being wounded in London, where he rented an apartment for a couple with the mysterious Sherlock Holmes. The initial antipathy soon gave way to genuine admiration, and then to friendship between two so dissimilar characters. Cheerful, cheerful, with a brilliant military bearing. An inseparable assistant and a reliable support for Sherlock. Vitaly Methodievich just perfectly fit into this famous role, and we will never see the best Doctor Watson. Bravo Vitaly Methodievich and the Kingdom of Heaven to you! 3. Mrs. Hudson, performed by Rina Vasilyevna Zelena, is the owner of the house where Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson live. A kind and endearing elderly lady who becomes an invariable attribute that complements the image of Sherlock Holmes. Rina Vasilievna played this role in such a way that there can be no question of any competition. This is her best role and the best Mrs. Hudson! Bravo Rina Vasilievna! Soviet viewers were delighted with these two episodes, so soon new ones were released, where our heroes had to face the ""Napoleon"" of the underworld and no less dangerous bandits, but I will tell you about this another time. As a result, we have a great start to the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson with excellent detective stories, great music and atmosphere, and simply grandiose in their splendor acting works!",

Yes it does rank with them. The film makes the book seem almost hesitant, tentative; Doeblin's debt to Joyce all too obvious. But the film has an almost 'punk' bloody-mindedness about it, like a fanzine. Strong-flavoured sauce splashed over chips. And although 'epic' ( in the Brechtian sense, not the Cecil B de Mille) it has shape like a Mahler symphony has shape - not a simple arc but a scratty, jumbly progress through a crowd that gets you there ... As for central character Franz - played as Der Dumme Michel rather than the devious weasel of the book - he's the one to whom learning is so often offered but who is so incapable of embracing it. Fassbinder makes us care to try to understand the person whom we would move away from so rapidly in the Kneipe. This is simply one of the (many) cultural pinnacles of the 20th Century. Thanks to Channel 4 for introducing it to us 20-odd years ago and thanks to Second Sight who has published it on DVD. Buy it! Make time and enjoy it!",

While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda.  However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.

Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series.  However what gets added to that is a much darker strand.  The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact.  This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion.  In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.

Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company.  The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett.  The two work well together and come together well for a great finale.  The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.

The characters are better here than the first.  The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here.  However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi.  Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.

Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better.  Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising.  All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date.",2H4M

Today I got the Cosmos DVD box set and went completely bananas!  I love it for two reasons.

First: Even for todays standards it is a well made documentation that will make you think about yourself and the world you live in. The Cold War may be over, but people are still as stupid as ever. Cosmos is not just a simple documentation about stars and planets with numbers, technobabble and nice pictures - it's a manifest for peace and understanding that EVERYBODY should see.

Second: I remember when I used to watch the series when I was ten years old. I didn't miss a single episode. Cosmos may not have CHANGED my life - but it certainly gave it a new direction. It taught me to keep an open mind and to care more about my surroundings. When I saw Cosmos today, I felt again like the little boy I was two decades ago. I'm in awe of the whole world and the wonders of the Universe that surrounds every one of us.

If you have kids: show it to them! If you want to know more about life on earth or on other planets: see it! If you think, ordinary documentations about outer space are too complicated to understand: see it! If you don't really care about the Universe, the stars and the planets, but you wonder what all the fuss is about: see it!

The struggle of two related families for the eighty-year-old aunt's inheritance through comic and romantic events.",1981-04-13,inheritance,8.6,pupedis,2006-06-02,"""Limuzins Janu Nakts Krasa"" (Limousine the Color of St. John's Night) is perhaps Latvians' favorite film. Like the American Christmas tradition of ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" it has become a staple on Latvia's TV screens around Jani, St. John's day, the Latvian celebration of the summer solstice. Written by Mara Svire it is director Janis Streic's best film. It is a film that can be watched on many levels. At the surface it is a broad comedy with universally recognizable characters and themes that are also uniquely Latvian. Aunt Mirta (Lilita Berzina) wins a car in a lottery and faster than you can say ""prieka"", relatives and acquaintances descend on poor Mirta's house like locust. There's her nephew (Uldis Dumpis) who, with wife and son in tow, gets off a tour bus in mid excursion and hitchhikes to Mirta's house for a visit the moment he hears of her windfall. There's her former daughter in law, with husband and daughter along, who pop in for a visit out of the blue. Even her next door neighbors, hard working and earnest farmers, are suddenly more helpful and attentive. None of this is lost on Mirta and she makes the most of it. It's a very Latvian film. There's a Latvian folk tale about a poor traveler who stops by a farmstead. Being hungry he asks the farmer's wife for some food and she promises him a meal in exchange for work. The labor is backbreaking, but he does it without complaint. When he finishes, the stingy farmer's wife tries to renegotiate. Pleading poverty she offers him some thin soup. He doesn't complain, but as he sips the watery brew he remarks that the soup is missing something. It needs something to go with the broth. The farmer's wife apologizes that she has nothing else to offer. All she has left is an old ax. The ax will be good he replies. The farmer's wife is incredulous, but he reassures her that in his travels he has often had ax soup and its one of the best meals he has ever had. You just have to know how to prepare it properly and it will be as tender and savory as the finest cut of meat. The farmer's wife seeing an opportunity to make something out of nothing drops the ax in the pot, but no matter how long they wait, the ax stays, well, as hard as an ax. The traveler suddenly remembers that the last time he had ax soup it also had some potatoes in it. Maybe that's what's wrong? The potatoes tenderized the ax. Unfortunately we have no potatoes. And just as suddenly the farmer's wife remembers that she might have some potatoes after all. Into the pot they go. The ax is still as hard. Maybe it was the carrots? There's carrots. Cabbage? Here's cabbage. On and on and into the pot they all go. Of course the ax never becomes any softer, but in the meantime the traveler has himself quite the meal. ""Limuzins"" is like that folk tale in reverse. It's the poor old farmer Mirta who exploits the greed of her guests. It doesn't take long before they are cutting her grass, building her a new cellar and doing all of her cooking and cleaning. All begging at the chance for being the one's to end up with the car. The film can also be viewed as one of those typical Soviet morality plays about bourgeoisie values being a corrupter of the human spirit. However, most importantly it's a film that took this very superficial party line and, between the lines, managed to pillory and parody that very same Soviet system. Where else but in the Soviet Union would an 80 year old woman who can't drive would end up with a car that she has no use for and doesn't really want, while everyone else has to scrape and then wait for years to end up with one? Even the title itself is a sarcastic reference to a car that was the Soviet equivalent of a Ford Pinto in a color that can be best described as off-white. ""Limuzins"" works on all of those levels. Like most of Streic's films its about characters and relationships. Its filled with humor and warmth and great performances, but it is it's ability to amuse while parodying a system that didn't tolerate being parodied that is perhaps its greatest achievement.",1H24M

Nothing has fundamentally changed: Smiley is brought out of retirement for one last round of spy games against Karla, his old nemesis. The 'old guard' which he visits (Connie, Esterhase) looks phased and weathered. The moral lines are blurry. The notion is that the world has changed, and doesn't really need these people any more. Smiley will be disowned by the Circus if discovered.

That's all fine. The series is from the great BBC tradition in narrative: the acting is uniformly excellent, it is a clean and riveting piece of fiction. Moreover, it is filmed in that BBC way I adore—transparent camera, natural light and textures.

Which brings me to a point I made in my Tinker Tailor post. I recommend this simply on its storytelling capacity to immerse you. And if you want a glimpse of how 1970's West Europe was like, it is indispensable viewing, absolutely so. 

But, it's also a spy film, and a spy film is to my mind one of the best templates for cinematic meditation.

Here's what I mean. You enter a world of some complexity that has machinery and movement, but enter long after the machinery has been set in motion. In the films, you (in the detective's shoes) are looking for this or that narrative device, here it turns out to be a girl, doesn't matter. 

In this film, the story really has started long before we enter, but you only learn this as you move through the first couple of episodes—in other words, midway through you suddenly have memories of this world. (one episode is capped by Smiley actually having a flashback)

So, because you have only a partial view of the story (reflected in the film in a crucial bit of evidence being a film strip), and the story shifts as you move through (indeed, you don't know there is a testimony that goes with the strip), this would be like a chess game where each new move shuffles the rules, trying to make sense is not enough. You will have to be still long enough for the thing to reveal itself. You have to spy.

Isn't this nice? You as a viewer will have to be able to see every corner while not being bogged down by detail. Indeed, whereas the bulk of intelligence operatives work as analysts, a good analyst is worth his weight in gold because he does just this: he can flow through a sea of information, salvaging only the crucial bits, the anchors that explain the story.

So, my notion of a good spy film is one that makes watching itself have agency in the world—any film would benefit from this, hence why a template. This is a step-up from Tinker Tailor, where after each episode we were summoned for a recap by the master sleuth, everything smoothed out for us. 

Oh, later episodes are forwarded by explanatory monologues and the story, as it turns out, is a personal bet so doesn't threaten an empire, but you have this structure and double identity of the girl at the center, which are fresh and powerful devices. And the sense of place is powerful —Paris, the Hamburg strip club and lake camp, quiet picturesque Bern, Berlin and the simmering anxiety of the Wall.

But the best piece of news is this: there is talk of a sequel to the recent Tinker Tailor film, which is going to be this one (alas for 'Schoolboy'). 

The film has what both of these don't, though they are otherwise excellent. It has abstraction in the film. It has not just the 'magicians' tricks, but magic that alters how we see. So, I'm hoping they go ahead with it, they will be building—as the first time—from a great primary text.",

Michael Jackson's album was slaying the charts, John Landis still had a lot of good will built up from his genre pic ""An American Werewolf In London"", (not to mention his classic comedies ANIMAL HOUSE and THE BLUES BROTHERS) and choreographer Michael Peters was creating some of the most innovative and influential pieces for music videos of that period.

Not before or since has one single piece of film illuminated, exploited or underscored MJ's incredible talent or the more ""otherworldly"" aspects of his persona quite like THRILLER, the world's most successful (if not officially the first) long-form video, and the most fondly remembered. Also the most expensive at the time, but every penny and every bit of the talent behind its creation and execution is up there on the screen. And how would it not be complete without the ""rap"" from the original song, provided by the late, great Vincent Price, to add even more cache to the chills already there? 

The glory days of one of the world's greatest performers have long since passed, but no one can ever take away the man's towering achievements, of which this is probably the most memorable.

This is what (television) drama should be. I saw the first Heimat when it was broadcast in the Netherlands in 1985, shortly after it was released in Germany. I was stunned. It seems that every decade one or two television productions excel, and this was without a shred of a doubt the eighties' highlight. When the second Heimat was shown on Dutch television in two marathon sessions (it runs for over 25 hours in all) I sort of locked myself in, and never regretted it.

I cannot begin to describe what Heimat is about. It's an epos. It's European history of the twentieth century on a small scale, literally. It's 'roman fleuve' and yet it's not. It's your family, that sometimes you wished wasn't there (and for good reasons) and then you're glad to meet again. It's all the human frailty and without the excuses. It *is* the human condition. And it only helps that it is beautifully shot, that the actors put on a superb show, that the music at times is haunting.

Now, on the verge of having the third series shown on TV, the first Heimat is finally available on DVD (with the other two series promised for the next few months). And although I saw most of it about twenty years ago, it is like coming home again and meeting your boyhood friends, those favourite aunts, that dear old uncle - what was wrong with him, again?

If you are looking for action, a thrilling plot, romance in a grand manner, wonderful CGI, and be done before dinner, don't look at Heimat. But if your willing to submerge yourself, to be engulfed by a very good story, to get really, I mean really, well acquainted with characters - well, I'm not in for commercial breaks, but go out and get it!",

I mean, could you imagine them slogging it out today, playing the state fair circuit, or worse, the street fair circuit? No, watch this film. See a band at its creative and energetic peak. Remember them as they were over the two or three days in which it was filmed. Of course, you must watch David Byrne. He would make his entire body a performance art. He would contort, jog, dance, leap, and even make his clothes a prop.

But, watch Tina Weymouth...

Tina is a very visual performer too. She says almost nothing, letting her bass guitar speak for her. And while David goes over the top often, Tina is subtle and sublime. With her body moves as she dances in place. With her facial expressions, her smiles, occasional raised eyebrows, and glances. Then when the action shifts to the Tom Tom Club (in order to give David a break and allow him to change into his big suit), her big moment is for one song only--""Genius of Love"" but man does she seize the moment and make it all her own! Rounding out the Talking Heads of course are drummer Chris Frantz (Tina Weymouth's husband for over 30 years now) and guitarist/keyboardist Jerry Harrison. When Chris takes the stage, he bounds up onto the riser, bows, and with a big smile, gets drumming. He is clearly enjoying himself during this and at the end of the show, he jubilantly throws his sticks into the audience. Jerry is a little harder to get a bead on. At times he's clearly enjoying himself, particularly on BURNING DOWN THE HOUSE. Other times he seems a little detached.

Rounding out the touring band are Alex Weir on lead guitar, Bernie Worrel on keyboards, Edna Holt and Lynn Marbry on back-up vocals, and Steve Scales on percussion. None are treated as sidemen, rather as an integral part of the show.

It has been commented that some ""sweetening"" of the sound was done. But I believe that it was to achieve sound consistency. I have heard several concert films with terrible audio (RUST NEVER SLEEPS comes to mind). Seeing this movie is what made me a Talking Heads fan back in 1985. Finding a copy at the used book store in 2006 is what helped me re-discover them.

It would be easy to dismiss the Talking Heads as all visual as all David Byrne. Such is not the case. The songwriting and musicianship was solid throughout the band's career. The band remained together for several more years, scoring several additional hits including AND SHE WAS, LADY DON'T MIND, & WILD WILD LIFE. They called it quits as a band in 1991, although all four members have remained active in music.",1H28M

It centers around the eldest son (Stimac) of a family led by a strict authoritarian father in Danilo Bata Stojkovic's magnificent incarnation. The young Petar struggles to graduate from high school mainly for one reason-he is so infatuated with his Marxism teacher that he cannot think of anything else but her during the classes. So when the graduation time comes, he lies to his father about passing in all the subjects while in reality flunking in Marxism.

Of course, the truth is not easy to hide and when it eventually comes out, his father is appalled and decides to punish him and lead his mind off from girls by finding a job for him in a local bakery. But that becomes complicated too when it turns out a beautiful and voluptuous girl is working there and she is an easy catch as well! Complications and comical twists just keep coming and coming here and the laughter never ceases. 

All this is going on during a very turbulent time, the '68 student revolution. My favorite scene is when Stojkovic throws out the TV because of the student uprising claiming it's immoral to watch it and then when Tito approves of the reforms he brings it back saying ""Comrade Tito has said that the students are right. We can watch television again!"" Paskaljevic was a master of socio comedy and all the actors do a great job. The ending is specially great and this is probably Slavko Stimac's best role.",1H31M

One also has watched a helluva movie. 

Back in the early 80's I called in sick (along with some friends) to see the opening of Petersen's Das Boot. We were all stunned. Went out for a beer and then returned to the theatre and watched it all over again. 

Petersen masterfully developed his cast into a crew who are no longer ""the enemy"" but fresh faced kids, neither prepared nor aware of the horror that was waiting them. When I first saw ""Das Boot""  I was the same age as those kids so it resonated more powerfully than I could have possibly imagined. In this wonderful uncut release of the original German miniseries we're forced to spend even more time with the crew of U-96 and in that time get to knew them better. We see friendships and bonds formed, the irritability that comes with lack of privacy and tension so dense it becomes an almost physical presence. We also get more of the sense of what war really is  immense spans of boredom and ennui interrupted by the occasional horrors of violence and death. 

Petersen kept his cast indoors and unshaven during the entire shoot with the resulting effect that the crew actually looks like a group of men who have not seen natural light, or breathed fresh air for 65 days. Additionally, the actors were all put through vigorous physical training so that when racing through the set of a dangerously reconstructed U-Boat, they move naturally with an almost balletic swiftness that is dazzling. 

This is masterful film-making of the highest order, with sound and lighting that capture the claustrophobic nature of a submarine, almost suffocating the viewer. The scenes of Das Boot racing through the Atlantic, it's difficult near fatal destruction in the narrow Strait of Gibraltar will have your blood pumping at fever pitch.

The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent, each actor - even ones with little to no dialogue, making bold indelible choices in developing their characters. 

Jürgen Prochnow as the Captain gives a remarkable, strong performance, making one believe - from the very beginning - this is a true leader of men.

You have no difficulty believing this crew standing behind this captain's every decision. 

Petersen's writing of Herbert Grönemeyer as the eager young reporter, Werner is a masterful creation. Werner becomes the multi-faceted prism through whom we watch and live this story. Part Greek chorus, part conscience of the uninvolved, we join him as an outsider on the inside, becoming participants in this heart rending drama. Grönemeyer's performance becomes the very soul of Das Boot.

""Das Boot"" remains one of my all time favorite films and to finally be able to own and see it as Wolfgang Petersen intended is one of the best things to happen since the invention of DVD.",

This is a further examination of how science and technology have linear relations that spark change through society that, although they may feel like waves, are merely triggers or lynch pins that put other discoveries and events into motion. And, once you know that, how are you going to embrace the new society in the late 20th century and welcome the coming changes in the 21st century.

The whole gist of the series is that once you have this perspective, and know that the world is what you make of it, then, in Burke's opinion, you should shape your world to your needs. And the the reason you should do that is to avoid the pitfalls and mistakes of the past, because he shows you how science and engineering brought society forward, but also how it pushed it back when things went wrong. 

And that's the real gem of the series. He doesn't show us outstanding successes by themselves, and then tout the virtues of science, logic/reason and applications of those methods, but also what drives men forward, and how some men are blinded by ego or desire.

That's about all the series is, though it also serves as a primer for the world about to be ""radically changed"". He of course speaks of the internet going public, and not just confined to labs and universities (as well as military installations), but given to the general public en large. He poses to us, the viewing audience, what if our community were boundless, and was not restrained by the old political boundaries that had held mankind back in previous ages?

From prehistoric man, to the classical era, to medieval times, to the renaissance, to the age of reason and beyond, Burke examines points in history and how that changed our ancestor's view, and how it shaped our present perspective. And he warns and asks us that, knowing this, what will we do with the future tomorrow.

It is a very welcome series shot on the usual UK 16mm format for TV of the 80s and before. Burke's esogination and presentation, as well as the theatrical vignettes, drive home his observations and educated us on passing facts that underline his lessons.

Definitely worth viewing for those of us who came of age before the 90s. Younger audiences may see this series as an anachronism, and who can blame them, because a lot of what Burke foretold has come about. Even so, give it a chance, if for no other reason than to see how us older folks viewed the world that eventually came into being.

Enjoy.",
